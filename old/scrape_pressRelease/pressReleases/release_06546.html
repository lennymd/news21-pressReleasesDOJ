              <div class="field field--name-field-pr-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even">  <p>  Nine Japan-based companies and two executives have agreed to plead guilty and to pay a total of more than $740 million in criminal fines for their roles in separate conspiracies to fix the prices of more than 30 different products sold to U.S. car manufacturers and installed in cars sold in the United States and elsewhere, the Department of Justice announced today. The department said that price-fixed automobile parts were sold to Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, as well as to the U.S. subsidiaries of Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industriesmore commonly known by its brand name, Subaru.<br /><br />These international price-fixing conspiracies affected more than $5 billion in automobile parts sold to U.S. car manufacturers, and more than 25 million cars purchased by American consumers were affected by the illegal conduct, said Attorney General Eric Holder. The Department of Justice will continue to crack down on cartel behavior that causes American consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for the products and services they rely upon in their everyday lives.<br /><br />Some of the price-fixing conspiracies lasted for a decade or longer, and many car models were fitted with multiple parts that were fixed by the auto parts suppliers, said Scott D. Hammond, Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Divisions criminal enforcement program. The Antitrust Division has worked hand in hand with its international competition colleagues who have provided invaluable assistance to the Justice Department in breaking up these worldwide price-fixing cartels.<br /><br />Todays charges should send a message to companies who believe they dont need to follow the rules, said Ronald Hosko, Assistant Director of the FBIs Criminal Division. If you violate the laws of this country, the FBI will investigate and put a stop to the threat you pose to our commercial system. The integrity of our markets is a part of the foundation of a free society. <br /><br />Including those announced today, 20 companies and 21 executives have been charged in the Antitrust Divisions ongoing investigation into price fixing and bid rigging in the auto parts industry. All 20 companies have either pleaded guilty or have agreed to plead guilty and have agreed to pay more than $1.6 billion in criminal fines. Seventeen of the 21 executives have been sentenced to serve time in U.S. prisons or have entered into plea agreements calling for significant prison sentences.<br /><br />Each of the companies and executives charged today has agreed to cooperate with the departments ongoing antitrust investigation. The plea agreements are subject to court approval. The companies and executives agreed-upon fines and sentences are:<br /><br />Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd. to pay a $195 million criminal fine;<br />Jtekt Corporation to pay a $103.27 million criminal fine;<br />Mitsuba Corporation to pay a $135 million criminal fine;<br />Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO) to pay a $190 million criminal fine;<br />Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. to pay a $14.5 million criminal fine;<br />NSK Ltd. to pay a $68.2 million criminal fine;<br />T.RAD Co. Ltd. to pay a $13.75 million criminal fine;<br />Valeo Japan Co. Ltd. to pay a $13.6 million criminal fine;<br />Yamashita Rubber Co. Ltd. to pay a $11 million criminal fine;<br />Tetsuya Kunida, a Japanese citizen and former executive of a U.S. subsidiary of a Japan-based automotive anti-vibration rubber products supplier to serve 12 months and one day in a U.S. prison, and to pay a $20,000 criminal fine; and<br />Gary Walker, a U.S. citizen and former executive of a U.S. subsidiary of a Japan-based automotive products supplier to serve 14 months in a U.S. prison, and to pay a $20,000 criminal fine.<br /><br />MELCO and Hitachi conspired with each other and other co-conspirator firms not charged today on sales of certain auto parts, including starter motors, alternators, and ignition coils, the department said. Mitsuba and Mitsubishi Electric conspired together and with other co-conspirators not charged today on certain sales of starter motors. Each of the other companies charged today colluded with other unnamed co-conspirators.<br /><br />Generally, the companies, executives and co-conspirators engaged in the various price-fixing schemes by attending meetings and communicating by telephone in the United States and Japan to reach collusive agreements to rig bids, set prices and allocate the supply of auto parts sold to the car manufacturers. They took measures to keep their conduct secret by using code names and meeting in remote locations.
