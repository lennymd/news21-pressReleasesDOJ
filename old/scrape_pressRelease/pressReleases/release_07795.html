Fifty-seven other individuals outside of the department are also honored for their work. Held at DAR Constitution Hall, this annual ceremony recognizes both department employees and others for their outstanding dedication to carrying out the Department of Justices missions.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This years award recipients have made significant contributions across, and far beyond, the Department of Justice and helped to protect the rights, safety and best interests of the citizens we are privileged to serve, Attorney General Holder said. I am grateful for the dedication and passion that these extraordinary public servants bring to their work, and I am honored to count them as colleagues.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Attorney General Holder and Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole present the <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service </strong><strong>  </strong><strong> the departments highest award for employee performance  </strong>to the team responsible for the successful prosecution of 10 New Orleans police officers convicted of killing innocent civilians in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service</strong> is presented to members of the investigative and litigation team responsible for one of the largest police-misconduct cases ever brought by the Department of Justice. The evidence discovered by the prosecution team revealed that shortly after Hurricane Katrina, several New Orleans police officers used assault rifles and a shotgun to shoot six innocent people on the Danziger Bridge, killing two and seriously wounding four others. In concert with supervisors and homicide investigators, the officers began a stunning cover-up. Ultimately, a jury convicted the defendants.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The recipients of the <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service</strong> include, from the Civil Rights Divisions Criminal Section, Deputy Chief <strong>Bobbi Bernstein</strong>; Special Litigation Counsel<strong> Forrest Christian</strong>; Trial Attorney <strong>Cindy K. Chung</strong>; Paralegal Specialist<strong> Steven D. Harrell</strong>; and from the FBIs Philadelphia Field Office, Special Agent <strong>William M. Bezak</strong>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Heroism</strong> is given to recognize an extraordinary act of courage and voluntary risk of life during the performance of official duties. This years award is presented to <strong>John M. Long</strong>, Senior Inspector for the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Investigative Operations Division. On Dec. 9, 2011, Mr. Long risked his life to protect a victim from a brutal attack by a dangerous fugitive wanted for abduction, theft and parole violation. Johnny Jones, a violent offender, broke into the home of his former wife, brutally attacking her. The following day while conducting surveillance, Mr. Long confronted Jones at gunpoint, grabbed the ex-wife and protected her from danger as Jones retreated back into the house. Mr. Long and his law enforcement partners then tracked Jones to a second location where he ultimately surrendered.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <strong>Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity </strong>is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor, dean and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department. This years award is presented to <strong>Stuart M. Goldberg</strong>, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. <span style="color:rgb(31, 31, 31)"> Mr. Goldberg is honored for his extraordinary professionalism in senior positions throughout the department over the course of more than 24 years</span></p>

<p><span style="color:rgb(31, 31, 31)">Over his distinguished career, he has performed his duties in each position of increased responsibility in such an exemplary manner that will serve as a model for excellence and professionalism in the department. Mr. Goldberg regularly handles sensitive matters with outstanding professionalism and leadership, and routinely ensures that department attorneys have the resources </span> <span style="color:rgb(49, 49, 49)"> and </span> <span style="color:rgb(31, 31, 31)"> training necessary to appreciate professional responsibility </span> <span style="color:rgb(49, 49, 49)"> and </span> <span style="color:rgb(31, 31, 31)"> ethics. Because of his extraordinary talents, Mr. Goldberg has played </span> <span style="color:rgb(49, 49, 49)"> a </span> <span style="color:rgb(31, 31, 31)"> leading role in many important department matters over the past several years. </span></p>

<p>The<strong> Mary C. Lawton Lifetime Service Award </strong>recognizes employees who have served at least 20 years in the department and have demonstrated high standards of excellence and dedication throughout their careers. This award is presented only in exceptional circumstances to those individuals of special merit and is not awarded to express general appreciation for tenure alone.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This years award is presented to <strong>John J. Dion</strong> Chief of the National Security Divisions Counterespionage Section. <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> Mr. Dion has been involved in the investigation and prosecution of almost every spy prosecuted in the United States over the past 31 years. </span>He is also a frequent lecturer at the FBI and in the intelligence community on national security investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Dions outstanding contributions have been recognized through the Intelligence Community Seal Medallion and the Medal of Distinguished Service from the National Reconnaissance Office.</p>
