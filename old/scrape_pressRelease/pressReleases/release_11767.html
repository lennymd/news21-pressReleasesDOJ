Thirty-nine other individuals outside of the department are also honored for their work. Held at DAR Constitution Hall, this annual ceremony recognizes both department employees and others for their dedication to carrying out the Department of Justices mission.</p>    <p>  It is my privilege to honor these recipients for their outstanding service and commitment to our country, Attorney General Holder said. Each of these dedicated servants has carried out the important mission of the Department of Justice and has done so with excellence and distinction. Their varied accomplishments have advanced the interests of justice on behalf of the American people, and Im proud to call them my colleagues.</p>    <p>  Attorney General Holder and Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden presented the <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service </strong> the departments highest award <strong> </strong>to the team responsible for the prosecution of<em> United States v. Ferguson</em>.The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service </strong>is the departments highest award.</p>    <p>  The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service</strong> is presented to the team whose investigation and prosecution ended a three-year crime spree, headed by former Los Angeles Police Department Officer Ruben Palomares. The six-year investigation and prosecution that broke this conspiracy resulted in 15 individuals pleading guilty and the conviction at trial of two others. Through their tireless dedication, teamwork, creativity and legal skill, they helped restore a sense of justice to victims and communities who had been preyed upon by the very people who had sworn to serve and protect them.</p>    <p>  The recipients of the <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service</strong> include, from the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division, <strong>Jeffrey S. Blumberg,</strong> Special Litigation Counsel; <strong>Joshua D. Mahan,</strong> Trial Attorney; from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California,<strong> Douglas McKinley Miller,</strong> Assistant U.S. Attorney; and from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Los Angeles Division, Special Agent <strong>Philip J. Carson</strong>.</p>    <p>  The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Heroism</strong> is given to recognize an extraordinary act of courage and voluntary risk of life during the performance of official duties. This year, the award was presented to <strong>Anthony J. Layfield, </strong>Senior Officer Specialist of the Federal Bureau of Prisons U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta.</p>    <p>  Anthony J. Layfield is honored for his commendable act of heroism. On June 2, 2008, a fellow officer was violently attacked by a highly aggressive inmate. As a result of Officer Layfields quick, decisive actions, and his continued attentiveness and dedication to duty, the life of a staff member was saved. This heroic act spared a family the loss of a husband and a father.</p>    <p>  The <strong>Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity </strong>is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor and dean, and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department. <strong>Edwin S. Kneedler, </strong>Deputy Solicitor General for the Office of the Solicitor General, is presented the award this year.</p>    <p>  Mr. Kneedler played an indispensable role in complex and time-consuming intra-governmental deliberations on diverse matters of great sensitivity and importance, including the handling of congressional subpoenas of former presidential advisors and presidential records, the proper treatment of Guantanamo detainees, the release of Office of Legal Counsel opinions, and the appropriate role and uses of presidential signing statements.</p>    <p>  The<strong> Mary C. Lawton Lifetime Service Award </strong>recognizes employees who have served at least 20 years in the department and have demonstrated high standards of excellence and dedication throughout their careers. This years award is presented to <strong>William J. Edwards, </strong>First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. Mr. Edwards is recognized for his outstanding legal expertise, managerial and supervisory skills, and his active leadership role as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. For more than 40 years, Mr. Edwards has fostered strong relationships throughout his federal career with the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) and other heads of federal, local and state agencies in support of the law enforcement efforts of this District. Mr. Edwards is an exceptional individual and role model who epitomizes professionalism and dedication as an outstanding federal employee.</p>    <p>  The<strong> William French Smith Award for Outstanding Contributions to Cooperative Law Enforcement </strong>is an honorary award granted to recognize state and local law enforcement officials who have made significant contributions to cooperative law enforcement endeavors. This years award is presented to Detective <strong>Deborah K. Scates </strong>oftheHartford, Conn., Police Department and Sergeant <strong>Christopher McKee </strong>of the Windsor, Conn., Police Department for their the investigation and prosecution of <em>United States v. Paris, et al.,</em> a high-profile sex trafficking case that resulted in the conviction of 10 individuals and the rescue of multiple women and juvenile girls that the individuals exploited.</p>    <p>  The<strong> Attorney Generals Award for Meritorious Public Service </strong>is the top public service award granted by the department, and is designed to recognize the most significant contributions of citizens and organizations that have assisted the Department of Justice in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives. This years award is presented to a team from the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Miami, Fla. Recipients include <strong>Dr. Selma DeJesus, </strong>Chief Psychologist; <strong>Dr. Sherri Skibinski, </strong>Drug Abuse Program Coordinator <strong>Nestor Chavez, </strong>Supervisor of Education; <strong>Lori Bearden, </strong>Case Manager; <strong>Giovanni Gras, </strong>Teacher; <strong>Mark Jones, </strong>Correctional Counselor; and <strong>Paola Londono, </strong>Unit Secretary. These award recipients developed the Inmate Change and Alternative Network (ICAN). ICAN is part of a re-entry program that focuses on networking with Federal, State, and local agencies to create a partnership and/or referral network that provides services to equip inmates for release.</p>    <p>  The <strong>Attorney Generals Award for Distinguished Service</strong> is the Justice Departments second highest award for employee performance. The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the departments mission.

This team led the administrations efforts, in close coordination with several client agencies, to obtain amendments to the Lacey Act, a 100-year-old statute that has served as the principal anti-trafficking authority in the United States to protect a broad range of fish and wildlife. Recipients include, from the Law and Policy Section, Assistant Section Chief <strong>Karen M. Wardzinski</strong>and Attorney Advisor, <strong>Thomas W. Swegle; </strong>and from the Environmental Crimes Section, Senior Trial Attorney <strong>Elinor Colbourn </strong>and Assistant Section Chief<strong> John T. Webb.</strong></p>    <p>  The <strong>John Marshall Award for Asset Forfeiture </strong>is presented to<strong> Lucille C. Roberts, </strong>Deputy General Counsel from the U.S. Marshals Service. Roberts receives the award for her distinguished service as the primary point of contact for the U.S. Marshals Service on matters related to asset seizure and forfeiture.</p>    <p>  <strong>David W. Gehlert, </strong>Trial Attorney from the Natural Resources Section of the Environment and Natural Resources Division is awarded the <strong>John Marshall Award for Dispute Resolution </strong>for his outstanding achievements in using alternative dispute resolution to settle a longstanding and high profile dispute over water rights for the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado. Mr. Gehlert used mediation to obtain a settlement that successfully concluded more than 30 years of litigation. Throughout what proved to be long and difficult negotiations, Mr. Gehlert exhibited professionalism, integrity, skill, and creativity that upheld the highest tradition of the Department.</p>    <p>  The<strong> John Marshall Interagency Cooperation in Support of Litigation Award </strong>is presented to the following recipients from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Professional Staff Group II: <strong>Richard J. Hipolit, </strong>Assistant General Counsel; <strong>David J. Barrans, David R. McLenachen </strong>and <strong>Michael J. Timinski, </strong>Deputy Assistant General Counsels; <strong>Ethan G. Kalett, </strong>Supervisory General Attorney; and <strong>Martie S. Adelman, Y. Keun Lee, Jamie L. Mueller </strong>and<strong> Martin J. Sendek, </strong>General Attorneys. This team is honored for their thorough understanding of veterans compensation and pension law. Their efforts have enabled the department to take consistent and sound positions regarding veterans compensation and pension law before the federal courts.</p>    <p>  Beginning in 2010, Attorney General Holder will present a new award, the <strong>Claudia J. Flynn Award for Professional Responsibility</strong>. This award is named after the late Claudia J. Flynn, the departments first director of the Professional Responsibility Advisory Office. This award will recognize outstanding contributions by a department attorney in the very important area of professional responsibility, which until now, has not been recognized through a specific Attorney General award.</p></div></div></div>    <div class="pr-fields">
