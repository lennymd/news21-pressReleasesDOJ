<p>As U.S. taxpayers, we enjoy many benefits, including the security provided by our U.S. military, the ability to travel on public roads and highways, and the beauty and enjoyment of national parks and monuments, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Tax Division. Those individuals who choose to accept these benefits and yet turn a blind eye to their federal tax obligations by failing to file required returns, filing false and fraudulent returns, and evading the assessment and payment of tax due will be pursued for their criminal conduct. No one is above the law or below the radar.</p>

<p>The Justice Department works with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other law enforcement partners to enforce the nations tax laws fully, fairly and consistently through both criminal and civil litigation. During the past year, the Tax Divisions prosecutions have included:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>April 2015  Daniel Porter, a Chino, California, businessman, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/designer-fraudulent-tax-promotion-product-sentenced-prison"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Las Vegas to serve 55 months in prison for conspiring to defraud the United States by promoting and selling fraudulent tax products, including a product called Tax Break 2000. The intended tax loss of the scheme was more than $60 million. Porter designed and sold Tax Break 2000 directly and through other individuals and entities, including NADN, a company in Las Vegas. Alan Rodrigues, NADNs former general manager and executive vice president, Weston Coolidge, the former president of NADN, and Joseph Prokop, a former NFL punter, were convicted at trial in a separate criminal case. In March 2015, Rodrigues was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ex-casino-owner-nevada-businessman-and-former-nfl-player-sentenced-prison-massive-tax-fraud"><u>sentenced</u></a> to serve 72 months in prison, Coolidge was sentenced to serve 70 months in prison and Prokop was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison to be followed by 30 months home confinement.</p>
	</li>
	<li>&lt; &gt; 2015  Arkan Summa, an owner of Happys Pizza franchises, was sentenced by a federal court in the Eastern District of Michigan to serve 18 months in prison and ordered to pay $199,847 in restitution for his role in a wide ranging conspiracy to defraud the IRS. The conspiracy involved diverting more than $6.1 million in gross receipts, underreporting wages and understating income and expenses of the pizza franchises. The total tax loss resulting from the scheme was more than $6.2 million. The founder of Happys Pizza, Happy Asker, was previously <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/happys-pizza-founder-convicted-multi-million-dollar-tax-fraud-scheme"><u>convicted</u></a> at trial, and three others have also pleaded guilty to related charges.<!--  -->
	<p>March 2015  Jon McBride, owner of a cell phone clip company and a real estate investor in Utah, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/utah-resident-sentenced-tax-evasion-and-filing-false-return"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Utah to serve 27 months in prison and ordered to pay $174,684 in restitution following his conviction for filing a false return and tax evasion. McBride filed a false tax return for 2005 that failed to report his gross income. He later filed a false amended return for the same year and again failed to report his gross income. McBride created several nominees to conceal his income and ownership in real properties to evade the payment of his taxes for 1999 through 2002, tried to evade the assessment of his 2006, 2007, and 2009 taxes, filed false 2006 and 2009 returns, and failed to file a return for 2007.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>March 2015  Paul DiLorenzo, a doctor from Ocean Township, New Jersey, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/monmouth-county-new-jersey-doctor-sentenced-46-months-prison-structuring-and-tax-charges"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in New Jersey to serve 46 months in prison and ordered to pay $304,293 in restitution for structuring cash transactions to avoid reporting requirements and for aiding and assisting in the filing of his own false tax returns. The court also ordered DiLorenzo to forfeit nearly $1 million in illegally derived proceeds.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>March 2015  Yvette Johnson was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/california-resident-sentenced-prison-tax-evasion-resulting-multimillion-dollar-advance-fee"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Maryland to serve two years in prison for tax evasion. Her husband, Shannon Johnson, was previously <a href="http://www.justice.gov/tax/2014/txdv14950.htm"><u>sentenced</u></a> to serve 72 months in prison for his role in the tax evasion and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Shannon Johnson held himself out as a wealthy international investment banker offering financing to businesses and investors, who wired and mailed advance banking fees to multiple bank accounts in different states controlled by the Johnsons. Shannon Johnson received millions in fees and payments, but never provided the promised financing. Yvette and Shannon Johnson filed false claims for refunds for the 1998 through 2001 tax years based on fictitious Forms W-2, and further evaded their taxes for the 2002 through 2006 tax years. The court also ordered Shannon Johnson to forfeit $3.7 million based on fraud committed against investors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>February 2015  Kenneth and Kimberly Horner, who owned and operated Topcat Towing and Recovery Inc., were each <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/georgia-couple-found-guilty-tax-fraud"><u>convicted</u></a> by a federal court in Georgia of filing false personal and corporate tax returns. According to the charges and information presented in court, between 2005 and 2008, the Horners skimmed more than $1.5 million in cash receipts from their towing business and deposited that money into their personal bank account without disclosing the income to their tax return preparer or on corporate and personal tax returns filed with the IRS. They owe approximately $400,000 in taxes to the IRS for their unreported income.</p>

</ul><p>Additional highlights from the U.S. Attorneys Offices include:</p>

<ul><li>April 2015  William M. Weisberg, an attorney from Vienna, Virginia, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/vienna-attorney-sentenced-tax-fraud-0"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Virginia to serve 12 months and one day in prison and ordered to pay $451,955 in restitution for willful failure to pay tax due and owing. According to court filings, Weisberg filed his income tax returns, but failed to pay his taxes for 2008 and 2010, and paid only a portion of his taxes for 2009.

When the IRS tried to work with Weisberg in 2010 to obtain the money he owed, Weisberg falsified a document from his law firm, which told the IRS that the firm was withholding money from his paychecks to give to the IRS, when, in fact, no money was being withheld.</li>
	<li>March 2015  Gwendolyn Muller, a receptionist previously employed by a medical office in Kearny, New Jersey, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/medical-office-receptionist-sentenced-34-months-prison-embezzlement-credit-card-fraud-and"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in New Jersey to serve 34 months in prison and ordered to pay $556,000 in restitution for embezzlement, using fraudulent credit cards to obtain goods and services and tax evasion. According to court filings, from 2007 through 2011, Muller used her position at the medical practice to take cash and conceal more than $446,000 in checks paid by insurance companies to the medical practice for services to patients. At various times during this same period, Muller also fraudulently obtained 10 credit cards in the name of a principal of the medical practice and used those cards to charge more than $218,000 in goods and services  a portion of which Muller paid for with embezzled funds. Muller admitted to filing a false tax return to evade the payment of taxes on this illegally obtained income.</li>
	<li>February 2015  Don F. Lindner, an attorney from Severna Park, Maryland, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/glen-burnie-attorney-admits-filing-fraudulent-tax-returns"><u>pleaded guilty</u></a> to filing a false return and agreed to pay $341,730 in restitution. According to court filings, Lindner practiced law in Glen Burnie, Maryland, and treated his law practice as a sole proprietorship. For his tax returns for 2007 and 2011, Lindner omitted $1,230,614 in gross receipts from his law practice. He also maintained a rental property and falsely reported on his tax returns that he paid more than $82,700 in repairs on the rental property during the same tax years, when in fact no repairs were done, thereby fraudulently decreasing his purported taxable income.</li>
	<li>February 2015  Rebecca Hoff, a former office manager and accounts payable bookkeeper from Ironwood, Michigan, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/wiw/press/2015/February 11, 2015 - Woman Sentenced for Failing to Declaire Embezzled Money on Tax Return.html"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Wisconsin to serve 15 months in prison for filing a false income tax return. According to court filings, Hoff used company checks to pay her personal expenses, which included the purchase of a vehicle, home improvements and mortgage payments.

Carlson deposited client investments and additional funds solicited from his father into a Trust Financial Group account, which he treated as his personal bank account. Carlson spent the money on personal items and, when confronted, lied to his clients about the existence of their investments. In addition to misappropriating assets, totaling more than $1.5 million, Carlson failed to file personal income tax returns for tax years 2010 and 2011. Carlson will pay approximately $3.1 million total in restitution, which includes $1.2 million in restitution to the IRS.</li>

According to court documents, Weiss filed false individual federal income tax returns for 2005 through 2009 and failed to file corporate tax returns for both of his companies, Custom Homes by D.R. Weiss Inc. and Reliable Home Solutions Inc. Between 2005 and 2009, Weiss paid personal expenses from a business bank account, accepted cash payments from customers of his businesses and failed to record the receipt of these funds on the books and records of the corporations, resulting in a total federal tax loss of $1,271,280.</li>
	<li>October 2014  Patrick J. Belzner, also known as Patrick McCloskey, a home builder residing in Selbyville, Delaware, was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/fraudster-homebuilder-sentenced-15-years-prison-defrauding-investors-19805-million-and"><u>sentenced</u></a> by a federal court in Maryland to serve 15 years in prison and ordered to pay $19.8 million in restitution on charges of wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud and tax evasion. According to court filings, Belzner worked for the McCloskey Group, a real estate development business, and conspired with others to defraud investors through a fraudulent investment scheme. Belzner admitted that investor funds were used to pay personal and business expenses, as well as to make partial repayments to earlier lenders and to pay fees to some of the victim investors to keep them from demanding the return of their money. In addition, Belzner admitted to stealing more than $1 million from former employers and failing to report those sums on his federal tax returns. He further admitted evading the payment of the tax due and owing by placing his residences, other real estate and automobiles in the names of corporations that he formed, as well as by paying his personal expenses  including his mortgage, ground rent for a vacation home, construction costs on a house that he built, car payments, Baltimore Ravens season tickets and private school tuition  from bank accounts he opened in the names of the corporations or from payments out of the real estate development business. In 2006 and again in 2009, Belzner submitted forms to the IRS falsely claiming that he did not have sufficient income to make any payments on the assessed back taxes, penalties and interest. By August 2013, the total assessed tax, interest and penalties due and owing by Belzner exceeded $2.6 million.</li>
