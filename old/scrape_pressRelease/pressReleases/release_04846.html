              <div class="field field--name-field-pr-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p>In a speech at a Justice Department ceremony honoring the late Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the nation must improve police officer safety at the same time that it confronts the sense of mistrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. As an initial step, the Attorney General called for better reporting of data on both issues, noting that the current level of reporting by localities on both uses of force by policeas well as officer fatalitieswas incomplete.</p>

<p>The troubling reality is that we lack the ability right now to comprehensively track the number of incidents of <em>either</em> uses of force directed at police officers <em>or</em> uses of force by police, the Attorney General said in his remarks. This strikes many  including me  as unacceptable. Fixing this is an idea that we should all be able to unite behind.</p>

<p>Currently, federal authorities publish annual figures on the number of justifiable homicides by law enforcement, as well as figures on the number of law enforcement officers killed or assaulted. But since reporting is voluntary, not all police departments participate, causing the figures to be incomplete. In his comments Thursday, the Attorney General urged improving the method for collecting both these sets of data.</p>

<p>This would represent a commonsense step that would begin to address serious concerns about police officer safety, as well as the need to safeguard civil liberties, he said.</p>

<p>A complete version of the Attorney Generals remarks, as prepared for delivery, appear below:</p>

<p>Thank you, Vanita [Gupta], for those kind words  and thank you all for being here. Its a privilege to welcome such a distinguished crowd to the Great Hall for this important observance and on what will be my last opportunity to share it with you as Attorney General. Its a pleasure, as always, to join so many valued colleagues and good friends in paying tribute to the enduring legacy of an extraordinary leader; in celebrating the contributions of a singular figure in our nations history; and in honoring the memory of a lifelong champion for equality, for peace, and for justice: the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p>I am glad to share the stage this morning with Dorothy Williams, Richard Toscano, Thomas Wright, and of course Assistant Attorney General Gupta. Id like to thank every member of the Junior ROTC Color Guard for opening todays ceremony. I want to extend a special welcome to civil rights activist Dorie Ann Ladner, whom were honored to have with us today. And I particularly want to thank all of <em>you</em> for taking time out of your busy schedules to participate in this annual event  on what should have been Dr. Kings 86<sup>th</sup> birthday  as we join millions of our fellow citizens, throughout the country, in remembering the man who helped to lead a sweeping movement that forever changed the face of America  and inspired people around the world to reach for opportunity and inclusion.</p>

<p>The remarkable and enduring achievements of the Civil Rights Era  in tearing down segregationist policies, expanding access to the ballot box, and enshrining key protections into law  did nothing less than alter the course of history. The impact of the Movement has been transformative, and its power impossible to measure, over the last five decades. Yet, as weve been reminded all too clearly in recent months  despite this once-unimaginable progress  theres no denying, as we gather for this important commemoration, that a great deal of work remains to be done. Even today, in 2015, our journey is not yet complete. Economic progress remains uneven, educational opportunity is still not uniform, the right to vote is under siege. And we continue to live in a world thats too often divided  a world riven by misunderstanding and despair. A world beset by momentous challenges, old and new. And a world badly in need of the compassion, the inclusion, and the healing that Dr. King stood for, and worked toward, throughout his too-short 39 years.</p>

<p>Especially in this time of trial, it is not only fitting  but essential  that we rededicate ourselves to the vision, and the values, that guided Dr. King at every stage of his career. Today  just as they did 50 years ago  these values point us <em>away</em> from tired rhetoric and stale talking points. They move us <em>toward</em> open dialogue and constructive engagement. They impel us to remember the common humanity that Dr. King found in every person he met  in police officers as in protestors; in prisoners as in presidents. And they call us to the service of our fellow citizens, the betterment of our nation, and the protection of all that is exceptional about the country we love. After all, as Dr. King once said, everybody can be great [. . .] because everybody can serve.</p>

<p>I am mindful, as we come together this morning, that there are few who answer this call to greatness more heroically  and fewer still who make more contributions and sacrifices in the name of public service  than those who stand on the front lines of our fight for public safety: Americas brave men and women in law enforcement.</p>

<p>As the brother of a retired police officer, I know in a personal way that these courageous individuals perform their difficult and dangerous jobs with extraordinary valor, compassion, and honor. They serve as steadfast guardians of our rights and liberties  shouldering tremendous and often-unheralded burdens. They incur significant risks in order to keep the rest of us safe. And they are routinely called upon to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and those around them.</p>

<p>In short, they are true American heroes  whose patriotism, integrity, and commitment to the highest standards of excellence are simply beyond question. I know this. And I have been troubled and deeply disturbed by recent mischaracterizations of this Administrations regard for those who wear the badge.</p>

<p>Over the past six years, our record of support for law enforcement has been both strong and unambiguous. This Justice Department, under my leadership, has taken significant, and in some cases unprecedented, steps to protect and empower our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement colleagues. This is simple fact. In 2011, I created an Officer Safety Working Group in response to concerns about officer-directed violence. Through groundbreaking initiatives like VALOR, the Department is providing cutting-edge training to help prevent violence against law enforcement, to improve officer resilience, and to increase survivability during violent encounters. Were currently funding thorough analysis of 2014 officer fatalities, including ambushes and other incidents, so we can mitigate risks going forward. Under our Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, were helping to provide lifesaving equipment to those who serve on the front lines. And through programs like the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program, were offering our strongest support to brave officers and their loved ones during the toughest of times.</p>

<p>As someone who knows firsthand the pride of seeing a family member in uniform  and the anguish that comes with knowing a loved one is in harms way, out patrolling the street  my personal support for those who serve has been steadfast throughout my career. I believe that every law enforcement officer is deserving not merely of our utmost respect, but our deepest gratitude. And thats why last months devastating and barbaric attack  which claimed the lives of two of New Yorks finest, Officers [Wenjian] Liu and [Rafael] Ramos  was so shocking, and so deplorable.</p>

<p>These senseless murders were assaults on us all  on our nation, on the rule of law, and on everyone who stands for justice. They serve as tragic reminders of the dangers that <em>all</em> of our police officers regularly face. And they have lent new urgency to our ongoing, national conversation about the need to reduce crime  while at the same time building public trust wherever it has been eroded.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Ill be traveling to Philadelphia to convene the latest in a series of roundtable discussions  with law enforcement leaders, elected officials, community members, young people, and civil rights advocates  in order to keep advancing this dialogue. Over the course of my travels throughout the country, Ive had the chance to discuss these critical issues with Americans of all ages, backgrounds, races, ethnicities, and walks of life  from Atlanta to Cleveland; from Memphis to Chicago.</p>

<p>Ive heard from police officers, protesters, faith leaders, and concerned citizens. On many occasions, I have been deeply moved by the stories and perspectives Ive heard  from parents hoping to secure brighter and safer futures for their children; from passionate young people becoming engaged in our national debate; from police officers valiantly putting their lives on the line to make our neighborhoods just a little bit safer.</p>

<p>Through <em>all </em>of these interactions, I have been struck not by the differences that have emerged, but by the remarkable commonalities. By the desire for peace, for safety, and for justice that drives everyone whos engaged in this discussion. And by the shared vision of a better tomorrow, and a more secure and inclusive future, that unites all Americans.</p>

<p>Let me be clear: <em>none</em> of these goals are in tension. None of our aims are in conflict. And so it is incumbent upon all of us to protect both the safety of our police officers <em>and</em> the rights and wellbeing of all of our citizens.</p>

<p>We can, and we must, examine new ways to do both. The first step to achieving this is to obtain better, more accurate data on the scope of the challenges we face. For instance, Ive heard from a number of people who have called on policymakers to ensure better record-keeping on injuries and deaths that occur at the hands of police. Ive also spoken with law enforcement leaders  including the leadership of the Fraternal Order of Police  who have urged elected officials to consider strategies for collecting better data on officer fatalities. Today, my response to these legitimate concerns is simple: we need to do both.</p>

<p>This would represent a commonsense step that would begin to address serious concerns about police officer safety, as well as the need to safeguard civil liberties. The troubling reality is that we lack the ability right now to comprehensively track the number of incidents of <em>either</em> uses of force directed at police officers <em>or</em> uses of force by police. There has been some effort to address this in the past  in the 1990s, for example, Congress enacted legislation intended to help the Justice Department collect data on officer-involved shootings. But since the reporting remains optional, and perhaps lacks sufficient incentives, many localities do not provide this data. Likewise, absent a requirement for reporting of injuries and deaths of police officers, many localities fail to report these statistics as well. This strikes many  including me  as unacceptable. Fixing this is an idea that we should all be able to unite behind.</p>

<p>On a more fundamental level, our shared objectives <em>also</em> require that we work together to confront the mistrust that exists  in some places  between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. This is why President Obama and I have announced a variety of proposals that will enable us to bridge these divides wherever they are uncovered  from a National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, to new funding for body-worn cameras. In recent weeks, I have also announced improvements to racial profiling guidance that applies to all federal law enforcement agents conducting law enforcement activities. And the President has taken the historic step of convening a new Task Force on 21<sup>st</sup> Century Policing  which held its first hearing just two days ago, and which  under the leadership of Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, former Assistant Attorney General Laurie Robinson, and other law enforcement leaders and experts  will provide strong, national direction to the profession as a whole, on a scale not seen since the Johnson Administration.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that these reforms are not aimed at individual officers <em>themselves</em>  who perform their jobs with distinction each and every day. Rather, they are intended to strengthen the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as the policies and procedures that shape this system and govern the way it functions. This will improve public confidence  allowing law enforcement to operate with maximum safety, effectiveness, fairness, and legitimacy  in every case and circumstance. And it will help to ensure that our present dialogue can be translated into positive, meaningful action.</p>

<p>We owe it to our brave law enforcement officers, to peaceful demonstrators  and, especially, to our youngest citizens  to talk forthrightly about the issues we face, no matter how difficult or complex they may be. We owe it to ourselves and our nation to seek areas of consensus, rather than to exploit old divisions and reopen old wounds. Most of all, we owe it to those who, throughout history, have fought, and sacrificed, and given their lives to bring our country to this moment  from Dr. King and the pioneers of the Civil Rights Era, to Officers Ramos and Liu and the colleagues who carry on their work  to lay aside meaningless grievances. To reject political posturing from those who only demonstrate their interest in front of television cameras. And to do everything in our power to confront the challenges of our time  and find a way to move forward  together.</p>

<p>During my visit to Memphis last month, I had the opportunity to tour the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Kings room is preserved just as it was on April 4, 1968  the night he was taken from us by the very same forces of intolerance against which he had stood throughout his life.</p>

<p>I could not help but think, as I stood on that motel balcony, about this great leaders unshakeable belief that promoting love  and condemning all forms of violence  is the only way to cut off the chain of hate.</p>

<p>I thought, as well, of the words of my predecessor as Attorney General, Robert Kennedy  who spoke about Dr. Kings legacy, and what he called the mindless menace of violence, just one day after Dr. Kings untimely murder. In that emotional speech, then-Senator Kennedy urged a grieving nation to remember that [t]he victims of . . . violence are black and white, rich and poor, young and old, famous and unknown. And he reminded us that  no matter where they came from or who they were  in life, <em>all</em> of these victims were . . . human beings whom other human beings loved and needed.</p>

<p>As we gather today, in the shadow of recent acts of senseless violence, I cannot help but reflect on the lives that have been lost over the past few months  in communities where tragic deaths have exposed rifts between citizens and law enforcement; in New York City, where two brave police officers were murdered because of the uniforms they wore; and in Paris, where heinous and cowardly acts of terror shocked the world and targeted the freedoms we all hold dear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of this is new to us. Senseless violence has coursed through the veins of this world for ages. And we have seen, throughout history, that acts of hatred breed only hatred. We understand that words of division only deepen division. And we know that our most serious and systemic challenges continue to demand the very best of us  just as they did in Dr. Kings time.</p>

<p>So today, once again, let us not shy away from  but embrace  the noisy discord of honest, frank, and vigorous debate. Never forget  this great nation was born of protest  by residents of this land who took to the streets to demand fairness from those who governed them. Let us never fail to support those who wear the badge, or to work alongside them in building a constructive dialogue  a dialogue founded on our common humanity. Let us act on the crucial recognition that those who serve with honor serve greatly  and they deserve our deepest respect. And let us reject the empty rhetoric of anyone who would engage in cynical attempts to divide and cast blame  choosing instead to affirm once more that Americans from all backgrounds and perspectives must come together to be part of positive change.</p>

<p>In this great country  a nation of laws and of high ideals  we have always had the power to forge our own future. Dr. Kings example offers inspiring proof of this fact. And thats why, as our present work unfolds  so long as we continue to rely on the engagement of our citizens, the ongoing commitment of our police officers, and the singular expertise and experience of leaders like you  I believe there is good reason for confidence in where this effort will take us.</p>

<p>I want to thank you all, once again, for your dedication to this work. Wherever I am and whatever I am doing, I will always be proud to count you as colleagues and partners in the work of making better the nation that we all love.</p>

<p>Thank you for all that you have done these past six years and for all that you will do in the years ahead. </p>
