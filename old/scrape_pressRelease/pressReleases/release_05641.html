      <h1 id="node-title">BNP Paribas Agrees to Plead Guilty and to Pay $8.9 Billion for Illegally Processing Financial Transactions for Countries Subject to U.S. Economic Sanctions</h1>
              <div class="field field--name-field-pr-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even">  <p>  According to court documents submitted today, BNP Paribas S.A. (BNPP), a global  financial institution headquartered in Paris, agreed to enter a guilty plea to  conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)  and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) by processing billions of dollars of  transactions through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Sudanese, Iranian,  and Cuban entities subject to U.S. economic sanctions.   The agreement by the French bank to plead  guilty is the first time a global bank has agreed to plead guilty to  large-scale, systematic violations of U.S. economic sanctions.<br /><br />The  announcement was made by Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Deputy Attorney  General James M. Cole, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the  Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for the  Southern District of New York, FBI Director James B. Comey, Chief Richard Weber  of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and District  Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. of New York County.<br /><br />BNP Paribas went to  elaborate lengths to conceal prohibited transactions, cover its tracks, and  deceive U.S. authorities. These actions represent a serious breach of U.S. law,  Attorney General Holder said. Sanctions are a key tool in protecting U.S.  national security interests, but they only work if they are strictly enforced.    If sanctions are to have teeth,  violations must be punished.   Banks  thinking about conducting business in violation of U.S. sanctions should think  twice because the Justice Department will not look the other way.<br /><br />BNP  ignored US sanctions laws and concealed its tracks. And when contacted by law  enforcement it chose not to fully cooperate, Deputy Attorney General Cole said.    This failure to cooperate had a real  effect -- it significantly impacted the governments ability to bring charges  against responsible individuals, sanctioned entities and satellite banks.  This failure together with BNPs prolonged  misconduct mandated the criminal plea and the nearly $9 billion penalty that we  are announcing today.<br /><br />By providing dollar clearing services to  individuals and entities associated with Sudan, Iran, and Cuba  in clear  violation of U.S. law  BNPP helped them gain illegal access to the U.S.  financial system, said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.   In doing so, BNPP deliberately disregarded  U.S. law of which it was well aware, and placed its financial network at the  services of rogue nations, all to improve its bottom line.   Remarkably, BNPP continued to engage in this  criminal conduct even after being told by its own lawyers that what it was doing  was illegal.<br /><br />BNPP banked on never being held to account for its  criminal support of countries and entities engaged in acts of terrorism and  other atrocities, said U.S. Attorney Bharara.    But that is exactly what we do today.  BNPP, the world's fourth largest  bank, has agreed to plead guilty and pay penalties of almost $9 billion for  performing the hat trick of sanctions violations, unlawfully opening the doors  of the U.S. financial markets to three sanctioned countries, Sudan, Iran, and  Cuba.  For years, BNPP provided access to billions of dollars to these  sanctioned countries, as well as to individuals and groups specifically  identified and designated by the U.S. government as being subject to sanctions.   The bank did so deliberately and secretly, in ways designed to evade detection  by the U.S. authorities.  For its years-long and wide-ranging criminal conduct,  BNPP will soon plead guilty in a federal courthouse in  Manhattan.<br /><br />According to documents released publicly today, over the  course of eight years, BNPP knowingly and willfully moved more than $8.8 billion  through the U.S. financial system on behalf of sanctioned entities, including  more than $4.3 billion in transactions involving entities that were specifically  designated by the U.S. Government as being cut off from the U.S. financial  system.   BNPP engaged in this criminal  conduct through various sophisticated schemes designed to conceal from U.S.  regulators the true nature of the illicit transactions.   BNPP routed illegal payments through third  party financial institutions to conceal not only the involvement of the  sanctioned entities but also BNPPs role in facilitating the transactions. BNPP  instructed other financial institutions not to mention the names of sanctioned  entities in payments sent through the United States and removed references to  sanctioned entities from payment messages to enable the funds to pass through  the U.S. financial system undetected.<br /><br />The significant financial  penalties imposed on BNP Paribas sends a powerful deterrent message to any  company that places its profits ahead of its adherence to the law, said FBI  Director James Comey.  We will continue to work closely with our federal and  state partners to ensure compliance with U.S. banking laws to promote integrity  across financial institutions and to safeguard our national  security.<br /><br />Todays outcome is a testament to U.S. efforts to stem the  exploitation of the American financial system and ensure that if you chose to do  business in our country you must abide by our laws, said IRS-CI Chief Weber.   BNP Paribas will forfeit the historic figure of almost $8.9 Billion  representing the proceeds of criminal activity.  BNPP had many opportunities to  take corrective action and abide by the law, and yet, despite warnings from  American regulators and other banks, consciously chose to ignore those warnings  and commit literally thousands of flagrant violations.  IRS-CI, and our domestic  and international law enforcement partners, will continue to pursue these cases  and follow the money trail  wherever it may lead.<br /><br />The most important  values in the international community  respect for human rights, peaceful  coexistence, and a world free of terror  significantly depend upon the  effectiveness of international sanctions, said District Attorney Vance.  Todays guilty plea marks the seventh major case involving sanctions violations  by a large international bank that my Office has pursued and resolved since  2009. These cases are critically important for international public safety and  the security of our banking system, which is put at risk when it is used to  further criminal activity.  The seven investigations have revealed a series of  widespread schemes to falsify the business records of financial institutions in  Manhattan and have resulted in the forfeiture of approximately $12 billion in  total. But, more importantly, they have resulted in a fundamental change in the  way all banks conduct their business, have heightened vigilance worldwide with  respect to dealing with sanctioned entities, and have increased the integrity of  our Manhattan-based financial institutions.<br /><br />BNPP will waive indictment  and be charged in a one-count felony criminal information, filed in federal  court in the Southern District of New York, charging BNPP with knowingly and  willfully conspiring to commit violations of IEEPA and TWEA, from 2004 through  2012.   BNPP has agreed to plead guilty  to the information, has entered into a written plea agreement, and has accepted  responsibility for its criminal conduct.    BNPP is scheduled to formally enter its guilty plea before United States  District Judge Lorna Schofield on July 9, 2014 at 4:30 p.m.<br /><br />The plea  agreement, subject to approval by the court, provides that BNPP will pay total  financial penalties of $8.9736 billion, including forfeiture of $8.8336 billion  and a fine of $140 million.<br /><br />In addition to the joint forfeiture judgment,  the New York County District Attorneys Office is also announcing today that  BNPP has pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to falsifying business  records and conspiring to falsify business records.   In addition, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System is announcing that BNPP has agreed to a cease and desist  order, to take certain remedial steps to ensure its compliance with U.S. law in  its ongoing operations, and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $508 million. The  New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) is announcing BNPP has  agreed to, among other things, terminate or separate from the bank 13 employees,  including the Group Chief Operating Officer and other senior executives; suspend  U.S. dollar clearing operations through its New York Branch and other affiliates  for one year for business lines on which the misconduct centered; extend for two  years the term of a monitorship put in place in 2013, and pay a monetary penalty  to DFS of $2.2434 billion.   In  satisfying its criminal forfeiture penalty, BNPP will receive credit for  payments it is making in connection with its resolution of these related state  and regulatory matters.   The Treasury  Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control has also levied a fine of $963  million, which will be satisfied by payments made to the Department of  Justice.<br /><br />According to documents released publicly today, including a  detailed statement of facts admitted to by BNPP, BNPP has acknowledged that,  from at least 2004 through 2012, it knowingly and willfully moved over $8.8  billion through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Sudanese, Iranian and  Cuban sanctioned entities, in violation of U.S. economic sanctions.     The  majority of illegal payments were made on behalf of sanctioned entities in  Sudan, which was subject to U.S. embargo based on the Sudanese governments role  in facilitating terrorism and committing human rights abuses.   BNPP processed approximately $6.4 billion  through the United States on behalf of Sudanese sanctioned entities from July  2006 through June 2007, including approximately $4 billion on behalf of a  financial institution owned by the government of Sudan, even as internal emails  showed BNPP employees expressing concern about the banks assisting the Sudanese  government in light of its role in supporting international terrorism and  committing human rights abuses during the same time period.   Indeed, in March 2007, a senior compliance  officer at BNPP wrote to other high-level BNPP compliance and legal employees  reminding them that certain Sudanese banks with which BNPP dealt play a pivotal  part in the support of the Sudanese government which . . . has hosted Osama Bin  Laden and refuses the United Nations intervention in Darfur.<br /><br />One way in  which BNPP processed illegal transactions on behalf of Sudanese sanctioned  entities was through a sophisticated system of satellite banks set up to  disguise both BNPPs and the sanctioned entities roles in the payments to and  from financial institutions in the United States.   As early as August 2005, a senior compliance  officer at BNPP warned several legal, business and compliance personnel at  BNPPs subsidiary in Geneva that the satellite bank system was being used to  evade U.S. sanctions: As I understand it, we have a number of Arab Banks (nine  identified) on our books that only carry out clearing transactions for Sudanese  banks in dollars. . . . This practice effectively means that we are  circumventing the US embargo on transactions in USD by Sudan.<br /><br />Similarly,  BNPP provided Cuban sanctioned entities with access to the U.S. financial system  by hiding the Cuban sanctioned entities involvement in payment messages.   From October 2004 through early 2010, BNPP  knowingly and willfully processed approximately $1.747 billion on behalf of  Cuban sanctioned entities.   In the  statement of facts, BNPP admitted that it continued to do U.S. dollar business  with Cuba long after it was clear that such business was illegal in order to  preserve BNPPs business relationships with Cuban entities.   BNPP further admitted that its conduct with  regard to the Cuban embargo was both cavalier and criminal, as evidenced by  the banks 2006 decision, after certain Cuban payments were blocked when they  reached the United States, to strip the wire messages for those payments of  references to Cuban entities and resubmit them as a lump sum in order to conceal  from U.S. regulators the banks longstanding, and illicit, Cuban  business.<br /><br />Further according to court documents, BNPP engaged in more than  $650 million of transactions involving entities tied to Iran, and this conduct  continued into 2012  nearly two years after the bank had commenced an internal  investigation into its sanctions compliance and had pledged to cooperate with  the Government.  The illicit Iranian  transactions were done on behalf of BNPP clients, including a petroleum company  based in Dubai that was effectively a front for an Iranian petroleum company,  and an Iranian oil company.<br /><br />This case was investigated by the  IRS-Criminal Investigations Washington Field Division and FBIs New York Field  Office.   This case is being prosecuted  by the Money Laundering and Bank Integrity Unit of the Criminal Divisions Asset  Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (AFMLS), and the Money Laundering and  Asset Forfeiture Unit of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of  New York.  Trial Attorneys Craig Timm and Jennifer E. Ambuehl of AFMLS and  Assistant United States Attorneys Andrew D. Goldstein, Martin S. Bell, Christine  I. Magdo and Micah W.J. Smith of the Southern District of New York are in charge  of the prosecution.<br /><br />The New York County District Attorneys Office also  conducted its own investigation alongside with the Department of Justice on this  investigation.      <span style="color:#171e24">   The Department of Justice expressed its gratitude to the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Treasury  Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control for their assistance with this  matter.<br /><br /><span style="color:#000000">   Documents associated with this press  release are available at: </span><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/bnp-paribas.html">http://www.justice.gov/opa/bnp-paribas.html</a></span></p></div></div></div>    <div class="pr-fields">
