Lynch recognized 376 Justice Department employees for their distinguished public service today at the 64<sup>th</sup> Annual Attorney Generals Awards Ceremony. Forty-seven other individuals outside of the department were also honored for their work. This annual ceremony recognizes individuals for their outstanding service and dedication to carrying out the missions of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>The Attorney Generals Awards provide us with a rare opportunity to honor the efforts of outstanding department employees and our invaluable partners across the federal government and at the state and local levels, said Attorney General Lynch. Their work has made our nation  and our world  stronger, safer and more just, and I am proud of and inspired by each and every one of them.</p>

<p>The <b>Attorney Generals David Margolis Award for Exceptional Service</b> is the departments highest award for employee performance. This years award was presented to the team responsible for the investigation and prosecution of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. On April 15, 2013, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev detonated two powerful improvised explosive devices near the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three, maiming 17 and injuring hundreds more in the largest mass-casualty terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. Following a manhunt during which the brothers killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shoot-out with police and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested. Members of the FBIs Boston Field Office oversaw a worldwide investigation that involved more than 6,000 items of physical and digital evidence, over 100,000 photographs and videos and more than 1,000 witness interviews. Tsarnaev was charged in a 30-count indictment with numerous crimes of terrorism and other violent offenses. Over the course of a 10-week trial, the prosecution team introduced over 1,000 exhibits and called more than 100 witnesses to the stand, including 14 victims who lost limbs in the bombings; family members of the murdered; other survivors and eye witnesses; fingerprint, DNA, bomb, ballistics and terrorism experts; and law enforcement officers. The prosecutors also cross-examined nearly 50 defense witnesses during the penalty-phase defense case. A jury found Tsarnaev guilty on all 30 counts in the indictment. He was sentenced to death on six counts and to life in prison on 11 other counts, and was ordered to pay $101 million in restitution to the victims.</p>

<p>The <b>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Heroism</b> is given to recognize an extraordinary act of courage and voluntary risk of life during the performance of official duties. The recipients of the <b>Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Heroism </b>are, from the USMS Northern District of Indiana, Supervisory Inspector <b>Diego Grimaldo</b>, Investigative Operations Division Inspector <b>Erick D. Brown</b> and Deputy U.S. Marshal <b>Kenneth E. Hausmann</b>.</p>

<p>While working on a task force investigating the location of a dangerous fugitive, who was wanted in Indiana for multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, Grimaldo, Brown and Hausmann tracked the fugitive to his sisters apartment. The team was joined by officers from the Chicago Police Department (CPD). As they approached the apartment, the group encountered gunfire coming from inside the building. A captain with the CPD was struck in the head and shoulder and fell to the ground. Hausmann immediately administered first aid to the captain, while Grimaldo and Brown returned gunfire. Within minutes, Grimaldo managed to make his way to a nearby apartment, signal to officers to call an ambulance and organize a plan to safely evacuate the injured captain. As Hausmann assisted with safely evacuating the captain to the ambulance, the fugitive continued to engage Grimaldo and Brown in gunfire. SWAT team members soon arrived and eventually took the fugitive into custody. Thanks to the teams extraordinary courage in carrying out their duties under a life-threatening situation, the police captain survived and has returned to full duty.</p>

<p><b>The William French Smith Award for Outstanding Contributions to Cooperative Law Enforcement </b>is an honorary award granted to recognize state and local law enforcement officials who have made significant contributions to cooperative law enforcement endeavors.</p>

<p>This years recipients are, from the Detroit Police Department, Sergeants <b>Ian M. Becker </b>and <b>David Wasmund</b> and Task Force Officers <b>Jason R. Criner</b>, <b>Treva L. Eaton</b>, <b>Darell Fitzgerald</b> and <b>Anthony Jones</b>; from the Livonia Police Department, Sergeant <b>Gregory Yon</b>; from the Oakland County Sheriffs Office, Task Force Officer <b>Brian W.

<p>On March 2, 2015, the USMS Task Force in Indianapolis requested aid from the USMS Detroit Fugitive Apprehension Team to assist with an Amber Alert case for two children abducted at gunpoint from their homes in Indiana. The team immediately responded by coordinating with multiple state and local law enforcement and the Detroit FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, resulting in a quick and thorough investigation and rescue of the two children. The recipients experience in cooperative law enforcement was evident in the swift and safe rescue and arrests that occurred without harm to the children or the community. The established partnerships and cooperation between the federal, state and local law enforcement agencies were crucial to the successful investigation and rescue in this abduction case and in the many other cases the team works on a daily basis. The teams performance, dedication and cooperative efforts saved the lives of two abducted children and made the communitys period of fear short-lived. The lives of the children could have turned out very differently if not for the excellent participation and cooperative interagency effort made by the six state and local law enforcement agencies that make up this team of exceptional officers.</p>

<p><b>The Attorney Generals Award for Meritorious Public Service </b>is the top public service award granted by the department, and is designed to recognize the most significant contributions of citizens and organizations that have assisted the department in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives. This years recipient is <b>Michael J. Nila</b>, the founder of Blue Courage.</p>

<p>Nila is honored for his significant contributions to state and local law enforcement and communities nationwide. During his law enforcement career, he recognized a significant gap between what we want our countrys police officers to be and how the law enforcement profession is currently educating its personnel. To address this gap, Nila developed Blue Courage, a blend of education, principles, practices, skills and tools that foster a culture of leadership, character and service. Blue Courage focuses on the heart and mind which represents the foundation to making good decisions and enhancing the capacity to serve honorably. Today, over 10,000 officers have been trained in Blue Courage and its principles are now infused in recruiting and police academy curricula in four states, with an additional 10 states competing to go through the process. As a direct result of Blue Courage training, officers are more in tune with and aware of their thoughts and behaviors. Furthermore, they have tools to become centered and balanced, and are reminded of why they joined the law enforcement profession. Through Blue Courage, Nila has demonstrated he is a committed and effective partner in the departments efforts to inspire and engage our nations state and local law enforcement officers, and to strengthen relationships with communities nationwide.</p>

<p>The <b>Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity </b>is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor, dean and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department. This years award is presented to <b>Lee J. Lofthus</b>, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.</p>

<p>Lofthus exemplifies the very best in executive leadership and has demonstrated three decades of dedication to public service which have resulted in outstanding organizational achievements. As the U.S. Department of Justices Senior Management Official, he provides effective leadership, directing diverse and complicated financial and budgetary programs, human resources, procurement, facilities, security and information technology activities. His career in public service has been distinguished by an unfaltering dedication to lead, motivate and inspire people. His vision, adaptability and commitment to customer service enable him to direct organizations through many complex endeavors and times of uncertainty.

<p>The <b>Attorney Generals Award for Distinguished Service</b> is the Justice Departments second-highest award for employee performance. The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the departments mission. Seventeen Distinguished Service Awards are presented this year to individuals or teams of people.</p>

<p>The first Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFs) Violent Crime Intelligence Division, Special Agents <b>Tolliver L. Hart</b> and <b>Clinton F. Kehr</b>, Intelligence Research Specialists <b>Lianne S. Binckes</b>, <b>Robert D. Blevins</b> and <b>Jenise Ramos</b>, Industry Operations Intelligence Specialists <b>Jill M. Hansen </b>and <b>Nicholas A. Speranza Jr.</b>, Intelligence Program Specialist <b>Daniel R. Mullins</b>, Information Technology Specialists <b>Laurie J. Powers</b> and <b>John E. Trice</b> and Management Analyst <b>Rhonda M. Butler</b>; and from ATFs Office of Chief Counsel, Attorney <b>Ellen V. Endrizzi</b>.</p>

<p>ATFs Internet Investigations Center (IIC) is recognized for its outstanding determination, perseverance and subject-matter expertise to support ATFs work to combat internet-based firearms crimes and related violations. The team, in conjunction with department guidance, drafted ATFs internet investigations policy and established numerous standard operating procedures for ATFs investigative and intelligence footprint online. The recipients also provided current, pertinent training to law enforcement audiences both inside and outside of ATF. Through the use of advanced technology, coupled with finely honed analytic and investigative skills, IIC personnel made its mark on illegal firearms transactions on all levels of the internet. This work was not only commended by partner law enforcement agencies, but the team was also recognized by an illicit Darknet vendor that named ATF specifically as one of the reasons it ceased illegal firearms transactions on its website.</p>

<p>The second Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Divisions Litigation III Section, Section Chief <b>David C. Kully</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>William H. Jones II</b>, <b>John R. Read</b>, <b>Adam C. Speegle</b> and <b>Nathan P. Sutton</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Appellate Section, Section Chief <b>Kristen C. Limarzi</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Shana M. Wallace</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Washington II Criminal Section, Trial Attorney <b>Daniel McCuaig</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Economic Regulatory Section, Assistant Section Chief <b>Jeffrey M. Wilder</b> and Economist <b>Alexander Raskovich</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Economic Litigation Section, Economists <b>William T. Whalen</b> and <b>Tor Winston</b>; from the Antitrust Division Litigation II Section, Assistant Section Chief <b>Stephanie A. Fleming</b>; and from the Criminal Divisions Appellate Section, Trial Attorney <b>Finnuala K. Tessier</b>.</p>

<p>The Antitrust Divisions victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages. The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apples appeal. In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent. The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government. However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Apples vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apples petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuits decision affirming Judge Cotes order. The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial courts and Second Circuits decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.</p>

<p>The third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Divisions New York Office, Section Chief <b>Jeffrey D. Martino</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>Bryan C. Bughman</b>, <b>Joseph Muoio Jr.</b> and <b>Carrie A. Syme</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Chicago Office, Trial Attorney <b>Eric L. Schleef</b>; from the Antitrust Divisions Washington Criminal I Section, Trial Attorney <b>George S. Baranko</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section, Principal Deputy Chief <b>Sandra L. Moser</b>, Deputy Chief <b>Benjamin Singer</b> and former Deputy Chief <b>Daniel A. Braun</b>, Assistant Chief <b>Albert B. Stieglitz Jr.</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>Melissa Aoyagi</b> and <b>Gary A. Winters</b>; and from the FBIs Washington Field Office, Special Agents <b>Jennifer Riker</b> and <b>Jeffrey Weeks</b> and Forensic Accountant <b>Kyle D. Dornbos</b>.</p>

<p>The recipients, through their leadership, dedication and tireless investigation of price fixing and bid rigging, are responsible for the historic prosecution of five of the worlds largest financial institutions that agreed to pay fines in excess of $2.7 billion. The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate. These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day. The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.</p>

<p>The fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor General <b>Eric J. Feigin</b>; from the Civil Rights Divisions Appellate Section, Chief <b>Diana K. Flynn</b>, Principal Deputy Chief <b>Sharon M. McGowan</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Robert A. Koch</b>; and from the Civil Divisions Appellate Staff, Director <b>Douglas N. Letter</b> and Attorneys <b>Jeffrey E. Sandberg</b> and <b>Abby C. Wright</b>.</p>

<p>In Obergefell v. Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage. In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administrations strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case. Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue. The brief reiterated the departments US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families. In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court.</p>

<p>The fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Divisions Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy Chief <b>Matthew R. Stiglitz</b>, Special Counsel <b>Stacey Luck</b> and Paralegal Specialist <b>Linda Faulk</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, Associate Director <b>Magdalena Boynton</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Division, Judicial Attach <b>Marlon Cobar</b>; from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. Attorney <b>Michael P. BenAry</b>; from the FBIs Miami Field Office, Special Agent <b>Charles M. Bryden</b> and Supervisory Intelligence Analyst <b>Raquel de la Huerta</b>; from the FBIs Counterterrorism Division, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Rodney Cortes</b>; from the FBIs Criminal Investigative Division, Unit Chief <b>Edgar Cruz</b>; from the FBIs Legal Attach Santo Domingo, Supervisory Special Agent <b>N.I. Delgado Jr.</b>; from the FBIs Legal Attach Bogota, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Andres E. Quintero</b>; from the FBIs Washington Field Office, Special Agent <b>Beau Bourgeois</b>; and from the U.S. Department of States Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Special Agent <b>Suhaib Karim Qureshi</b>.</p>

<p>On June 20, 2013, DEA Special Agent James Terry Watson was stabbed to death during an attempted kidnapping and robbery perpetrated by an organized group of taxi drivers in Bogota. A team of investigators and prosecutors was assembled, and working with their Colombian counterparts, they quickly identified seven individuals responsible for the murder and subsequent destruction of evidence. In an example of teamwork and coordination at its best, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants were obtained for the suspects within four days of the crime; within 18 months, the defendants extraditions were secured and they were all convicted. Because of the diligent work of those assigned to the case, justice was served for the family of Special Agent Watson.</p>

<p>The sixth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Chief <b>Steven J. Grocki</b> and Deputy Chief <b>Keith A. Becker</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney <b>Sarah Chang</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, Senior Trial Attorney <b>Judith Friedman</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Appellate Section, Attorney <b>David M. Lieberman</b>; from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the District of Nebraska, Senior Litigation Counsel <b>Michael. P. Norris</b> and Paralegal Specialist <b>Harolene J. Bailey</b>; from the FBIs Office of the General Counsel, General Attorney <b>Joanne C. Pasquarelli</b>; from the FBIs Criminal Investigative Division, Unit Chief <b>Alan S. Nanavaty</b>, Supervisory Special Agents <b>K. Paul Cha</b>, <b>J. Brooke Donahue</b> and <b>P. Michael Gordon</b> and Intelligence Analyst <b>Robert Plumb</b>; from the FBIs Cyber Division, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Steven A. Smith Jr.</b>; from the FBIs Critical Incident Response Group, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Daniel E. ODonnell</b>; and from the FBIs Omaha Field Office, Special Agents <b>Sara K. Stanley</b> and <b>Jeffrey D. Tarpinian</b>.</p>

<p>The recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Torpedo, a precedent-setting investigation that used first-of-its-kind techniques to infiltrate the dark internet and identify individuals who, under the perceived cloak of anonymity, secretly congregated to trade images of children being sexually abused and to celebrate the sexual abuse of children. By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network. The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments. Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn. The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated. It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>The seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy Chief <b>Franz R. Marshall</b> of the Civil Rights Divisions Educational Opportunities Section. Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country. Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in Americas public schools. Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students. He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou. In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v. Board of Education.</p>

<p>The eighth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Environment and Natural Resources Divisions Environmental Enforcement Section, Section Chief <b>Thomas A. Mariani Jr.</b>, Assistant Section Chief <b>William D. Brighton</b>, Senior Litigation Counsel e-Discovery <b>Sarah D. Himmelhoch</b>, Senior Counsels <b>Patrick M. Casey</b>, <b>Scott M.

Shutler </b>and<b> Jessica G. Sullivan</b>; and from the Civil Divisions Commercial Litigation Branch  Fraud Section, Senior Trial Counsel <b>Daniel A. Spiro</b>.</p>

<p>To redress the BP/Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, this team successfully pursued the companies responsible for this multimillion-barrel oil spill. The recipients resolved the nations civil claims against those companies for more than $6.6 billion in civil penalties; more than $8 billion in natural resource damages; hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, assessment and other costs; and injunctive relief that should make for safer drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Under applicable law, the majority of these funds will fuel restoration of natural resources and some economic redevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico region. The matter is the departments largest-ever environmental enforcement effort. The teams work also made it possible for the five Gulf states and their local governments to settle their economic damage claims for sums approaching another $5.9 billion.</p>

<p>The ninth Distinguished Service Award is presented to Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Michelle B. Alvarez</b>,<b> Jeffrey N. Kaplan</b>,<b> Lawrence D. LaVecchio</b>, <b>Alison W. Lehr</b>,<b> Paul F. Schwartz</b>,<b> Evelyn B. Sheehan </b>and <b>Madeleine Shirley </b>of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida.</p>

<p>In October 2009, it was discovered that attorney Scott Rothstein was conducting one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history through the operation of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt &amp; Adler P.A. (RRA). The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases. Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars. During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRAs ability to attract new investors. During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations. Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.</p>

<p>The 10<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>John P. Cronan</b>, <b>Edward Y. Kim</b>, <b>Ian McGinley </b>and<b> Shane T. Stansbury</b>, Criminal Investigator <b>George F. Corey Jr.</b> and Paralegal Specialists <b>Melissa C. Danzo </b>and <b>Vanessa Quinoes</b>; from the FBIs New York City Field Office, Special Agents <b>Jonathan B. Geraci </b>and<b> Philip A. Swabsin</b>; from the FBIs New Haven Field Office, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Michael S. Butsch</b>; and from the National Security Divisions Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Assistant Attorney General <b>George Z. Toscas</b>.</p>

<p>For upwards of a decade, Abu Hamza stood as one of the most powerful, dangerous and recognizable terrorist leaders on the planet. Through his oratorical skills and sophisticated use of the internet, he indoctrinated his young, impressionable followers with his murderous message, inspiring the likes of Richard Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui and Mohammed Siddiqui Kahn. Additionally, Abu Hamza himself engaged in acts of terror that spanned the globe including the December 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, which included two U.S. citizens and left four victims dead; the attempt to establish a terrorist training camp for al Qaeda on U.S. soil in late 1999; sending of one of his devoted followers to Afghanistan in 2000 to train and fight with al Qaeda; and supporting the Taliban from 2000 to 2001. Abu Hamza was arrested in the United Kingdom in 2004, but fought extradition for nearly a decade before he was extradited in October 2012. In preparing for trial, the recipients analyzed massive volumes of evidence recovered from across the globe, and identified witnesses in multiple continents to build and solidify a criminal case. The team also engaged in classified and unclassified litigation leading to and during trial, working in close coordination with the U.S. intelligence community to protect national security equities. Overcoming the inherent challenges in prosecuting a case where the conduct occurred approximately 15 years earlier, and where the evidence and witnesses were spread across the globe, the team secured a conviction on all 11 counts. Furthermore, Abu Hamza has been permanently incapacitated from future terrorist acts.</p>

<p>The 11<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the FBIs Washington Field Office, Supervisory Special Agent <b>William J. DelBagno</b>; from the FBIs Seattle Field Office, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Christian L. Parker</b>, Special Agents <b>Eric Jon Barker</b>, <b>Ryan D. Butler</b> and <b>David S. Whitlow</b>, Forensic Accountant <b>Jennifer J. Boswell</b>, Intelligence Analyst <b>Mark J. Fitterer</b> and Staff Operations Specialist <b>Morgan L. Reid</b>; from the FBIs International Operations Division, Supervisory Special Agent <b>James B. Volkert</b>; from the FBIs Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Directorate, Supervisory Intelligence Analyst <b>Christina Ruetschlin</b>; from the FBIs Miami Field Office, Special Agent <b>Paul C. Clark</b>; from the FBIs Pittsburgh Field Office, Special Agent <b>James K. Shearer</b>; from the FBIs San Francisco Field Office, Special Agent <b>Mike P. Stahala</b>; from the FBIs New York City Field Office, Special Agent <b>Sara H. Wood</b>; and from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Washington, Assistant U.S. Attorney <b>Timothy Ohms</b>.</p>

<p>The recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Short Fuse (OSF), an innovative online undercover operation operated by the FBIs Seattle Division and WMD Directorate. OSF employs a highly specialized cadre of online covert employees and confidential human sources to detect, target and disrupt WMD threat actors operating in cyberspace. The operation works to fill a critical detection and intelligence gap by resolving the identity of subjects who have demonstrated the intent and capability to manufacture, distribute or purchase WMD while operating in anonymized, hidden marketplaces and forums devoted to the sale of prohibited items. OSF team members are subject matter experts in WMD investigations and the innovative use of online undercover techniques designed to pierce the veil of anonymity that most OSF subjects attempt to erect through the use of layered complex encryption and crypto-currency. To date, OSF has conducted undercover targeting operations in support of 95 FBI investigations, many of which began as a result of OSF intelligence collection. OSF has been responsible for the disruptions of 18 subjects who attempted to purchase, sell and/or use chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive materials in the United States and across the globe. These disruptions, often executed in coordination with international partners, undoubtedly prevented a significant loss of innocent life that would have otherwise resulted absent this sustained and extraordinary law enforcement effort.</p>

<p>The 12<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Northern District of New York, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Steven D. Clymer</b>, <b>Lisa M. Fletcher </b>and <b>Tamara B. Thomson</b>; from the FBIs Albany Field Office, Special Agent <b>Frederick E. Bragg</b>; and from the FBIs Washington Field Office, Special Agent <b>Alix Skelton</b>.</p>

<p>This team receives the award for its exceptional work in the case of US v. Stephen M. Howells II and Nicole Vaisey, which led to the recovery of two young girls who had been abducted, held captive and abused; the identification of four additional children who had been victimized by Howells and Vaisey; and the seizure of recordings and images of the defendants sexual abuse of children, as well as a large volume of child pornography depicting the sexual abuse of hundreds of other children, including infants and toddlers. This teams herculean effort, thorough investigation and analysis, and exemplary advocacy led to the conviction of Howells and Vaisey on all charges and their sentences to 580 and 300 years of imprisonment, respectively, the aggregate statutory maximums.</p>

<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the District of Colorado, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Bishop Grewell</b>, <b>Suneeta Hazra </b>and <b>Valeria N. Spencer</b>, Financial Analyst <b>Dana L. Chamberlin</b>, Victim/Witness Specialist <b>Donna R. Summers</b> and Supervisory Legal Assistant <b>Valerie J. Nielson</b>; from the FBIs Denver Field Office, Special Agents <b>Christopher A. Calarco</b>,<b> Jonathan D. Grusing </b>and <b>Patrick A. Kleckner</b>; and from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Rocky Mountain National Park Special Agent <b>Elizabeth A. Shott</b>.</p>

<p>The team in US v. Henthorn is honored for its outstanding, innovative work in the investigation, trial and conviction of Harold Henthorn for pushing his wife to her death from a remote cliff to collect $4.5 million dollars in life insurance. Due to their dedication, painstaking work and powerful trial presentation, the recipients did what many thought was impossible by obtaining a conviction in this difficult and wholly circumstantial case. The team not only proved that Henthorn murdered his second wife but that he had also murdered his first wife some 20 years earlier. Through the course of hundreds of witness interviews, thousands of hours of work, meticulous analysis of computer forensic evidence, cell tower records and bank records, the team decisively proved that Henthorn carefully planned and executed two cold-blooded murders. Furthermore, the team convinced the jury to hold Henthorn accountable and found justice for the victims and their families.</p>

<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Central District of California, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Brandon D. Fox, Gregory A. Lesser</b>,<b> Lizabeth A. Rhodes </b>and<b> Ryan D. White</b>; Legal Assistant <b>Georgina Y. Moreno</b> and Paralegal Specialist<b> Adriana Abalos</b>; and from the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office, Special Agents <b>David N. Dahle</b>, <b>Jason D. Dalton</b>,<b> Carlos A. Narro </b>and<b> Leah M. Tanner</b>.</p>

<p>This team receives the award for the historicprosecution of the former Los Angeles County Sheriff and 17 other law enforcement officers who obstructed a federal investigation and used excessive force against those they were charged with protecting. The recipients convincingly showed that no one is above the law; just as important, they showed that no one is beneath the protections of the law. The team proved through its tireless efforts and perseverance that the department will uphold civil rights for all Americans and that attempts at obstructing federal investigations will be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The 15<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the FBIs Washington Field Office, Cyber Division Supervisory Special Agent <b>Brenda K. Born</b>, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Andrew Patrick Leithead</b>, Special Agents <b>Sean P. Clark, Jenny M. Cutalo-Patterson, Tonya Sturgill Griffith, Alicia M. McShane </b>and<b> Jennifer N.

Pinegar, Ari B. Redbord </b>and<b> Lindsay J. Suttenberg</b> and Computer Forensic Examiner <b>John E. Marsh</b>; and from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department, Detectives <b>Jonathan K. Andrews Sr.</b> and <b>Timothy R. Palchak</b>.</p>

<p>The Washington Metro Child Exploitation Task Force has played an instrumental role in identifying, disrupting and dismantling the most egregious perpetrators in child exploitation and human trafficking within the greater Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and beyond its area of responsibilities. This team is recognized for its extraordinary dedication, innovative techniques and commitment in identifying and prosecuting these offenders. During 2014 and 2015, the work of the recipients resulted in the rescue of numerous children who were victims of ongoing abuse and exploitation. The task force also assisted in identifying and locating more than 60 victims of sexual abuse and child pornography.</p>

<p>The 16<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the National Security Divisions Office of Intelligence, Supervisory Attorney-Advisors <b>Alexandra Doumas</b>, <b>Stephen C. Eglin</b>, <b>Wendy L. Fritz</b> and <b>Kimberly A. Roemer</b>. This team is<b> </b>honored for its exemplary leadership in response to an unprecedented and unrelenting series of terrorist threats against the U.S. homeland. As the supervisors of the National Security Divisions Office of Intelligence Counterterrorism Unit, the awardees worked almost around-the-clock for several months to ensure that the FBI had at its disposal the legal authorities needed to further its investigations, including authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The team helped to advance critical counterterrorism investigations which resulted in the thwarting of various plots, and ultimately saving lives.</p>

<p>The 17<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Evaluation and Inspections Division, Senior Inspector <b>Kathleen E. Flanagan</b> and Program Analysts <b>Tanique D. Carter</b> and <b>Michael H. Chang</b>.</p>

<p>This team led a comprehensive review of the impact that an aging inmate population has on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The elimination of parole, use of mandatory minimum sentences, increases in average sentence length over the past three decades and an increase in white collar offenders and sex offenders, among other things, have contributed to the aging federal inmate population. The recipients were in the field for eight months, interviewing nearly 170 officials and staff from each of the BOPs eight divisions, as well as 13 institutions. The team conducted site visits of institutions at all security levels, and did extensive document reviews and quantitative analysis spanning a five-year period. Policies applying to various aspects of the care of aging inmates were numerous and scattered among different program areas. To overcome limitations in available data, the team conducted wide-ranging quantitative analyses. The OIG report, issued in May 2015, found that aging inmates are more costly to incarcerate due to increased medical needs, that the physical infrastructure of BOP institutions limits the availability of appropriate housing for aging inmates and that BOP does not provide programming opportunities designed to meet their particular needs. The report also found that aging inmates engage in fewer misconduct incidents while incarcerated and, based on statistical review, appear to have a lower rate of re-arrest once released. Beyond merely identifying these issues, the report provided eight concrete recommendations to address them in order to assist BOP in managing its aging inmate population. After reviewing the report and recommendations, the BOP created formed an interdisciplinary task force to address a number of the recommendations.</p>

<p>On March 3, 2004, David Magnan entered a house on an Indian allotment in rural Seminole County, Oklahoma, and with premeditation shot three Native American occupants to death as they lay in their beds. Originally convicted in state court under the misapprehension of the status of the land where the house was located, that conviction was set aside in 2013 after the 10<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Indian title to the land had not been extinguished. Working at great disadvantage given the passage of time, this team worked tirelessly to locate the witnesses and evidence necessary to secure a conviction at trial on all three murder counts, keep a dangerous killer off the streets and obtain justice for the victims families.</p>

<p>In December 2011, FBI opened a five-year investigation into ABN Universal Inc. Early investigative techniques revealed the U.S.-based owner and operator of ABN was Alexander Brazhnikov. Through an exhaustive use of human sources, video surveillance, forensic reconstruction, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, Title III surveillance of emails and computer analysis, the investigation revealed that ABN was procuring dual-use microelectronics from U.S.-based manufacturers on behalf of Russian companies directly associated with the Russian military and intelligence services. Moreover, employees of ABN were devaluing the price of exported products to Russia and using front company addresses in Moscow, an offshore virtual private network and an international network of shell companies to conceal the intended end-users from U.S. law enforcement. The investigative team worked diligently to overcome each of these obfuscation techniques to ultimately reveal the totality of Brazhnikovs criminal offenses. As a result of the investigation, in June 2014, an arrest warrant for Brazhnikov was issued for his illegal smuggling of export controlled U.S.-sourced goods to Russia and for conducting $65 million in money laundering. In June 2015, Brazhnikov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle goods from the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Brazhnikov also admitted to smuggling microelectronics to Russian defense contractors known to supply the Russian military and intelligence services, to include two Russian nuclear warhead design institutes. As a result of his guilty plea, the District Court of New Jersey issued a money judgment against Brazhnikov for $65 million.</p>

<p>Over the last year, the departments cybersecurity team has made significant enhancements to address the rapidly-changing cyber threat landscape, as the departments mission makes it a high-value target for adversaries attacking U.S. national security assets. This team implemented and continues to manage solutions which thwart adversaries attempts to breach the departments network, gain access to sensitive information and critically harm national security. These solutions provide the department with the ability to detect and mitigate advanced persistent threats, monitor malicious encrypted internet traffic, prevent data loss by encrypting personally identifiable information. This fiscal year, the teams enhancements stopped 55,000 malicious e-mails and 900 malicious web sessions. Also as a result, fewer cyber incidents occur, fewer remediation efforts are required and the department realized $8 million in cost avoidance.

<p>US v. Irek Ilgiz Hamidullin was a first-of-its-kind, Article III prosecution of a foreign terrorist who was captured in November 2009 by the U.S. military on a battlefield in Afghanistan. The investigation and prosecution lasted five years from capture to conviction, and the case required a massive interagency team of attorneys, law enforcement agents and support staff to work together, effectively navigating complex and unique challenges in a sensitive national security matter. Hamidullin was convicted by a federal jury of all 15 indicted counts, which included charges of providing material support to terrorists, attempted murder of U.S. military personnel, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence.

Recently, Woods was assigned a very high-profile and large-scale FOIA media request seeking information regarding use of government funds for commemorative and recognition items within both USMS headquarters and each of its 94 districts. Because of the breadth of the possible records and the effort required to capture all responsive information, Woods spent hundreds of hours in conversation with USMS district and division personnel conducting the searches and explaining the type of information to be included in responses. In addition, the request required coordination and consultation with other department components. Following her review of over 15,000 pages of documents, Woods created a custom spreadsheet in order to display the responsive information in a form which the requester could clearly understand. Additionally, she oversaw the process of compiling the information and ensuring its accuracy, and she coordinated the response package with the departments Office of Information Policy, which monitored and coordinated the request. Finally, Woods prepared the material for disclosure to the requester with an explanation of any possible discrepancies.</p>

<p>This team secured the conviction and 45-year sentence of Farid Fata, an oncologist who deliberately misdiagnosed patients with a variety of conditions so that he could fraudulently bill Medicare and private insurers for millions of dollars worth of unnecessary infusions, injections and other cancer testing and treatments. Acting on a tip, the recipients investigated and corroborated the health care fraud allegations, arresting Fata and shutting down his six Detroit-area practice locations. At the time of his arrest, Fata had over 1,700 active patients and over 16,000 historical patients. After his arrest, agents, prosecutors and staff worked around the clock to ensure that all of the patients, past and present, received their medical files and were routed to major medical centers for continued care. Over the course of the investigation, the team was able to prove that Fata had victimized more than 550 patients. In September 2014, Fata pleaded guilty to 13 counts of health care fraud charges, one count of health care kickback conspiracy and money laundering. In pleading guilty, Fata admitted to administering unnecessary chemotherapy infusions, iron infusions and human growth factors to patients; ordering unnecessary cancer tests; accepting kickbacks to refer patients for home health care services; and laundering money from his infusion fraud scheme to promote a new cancer testing fraud scheme.</p>

On July 1, 2015, the United States brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against GE and Electrolux, alleging that their proposed merger would raise appliance prices. In November 2015, trial began in before U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia. During a five-week, highly publicized trial, the trial team made its case largely through the documents and adverse testimony of GE and Electrolux, uncooperative competitors and economic analysis, demonstrating that the merger would have a significant effect on the prices of ranges, cooktops and wall ovens. One day before trial was to conclude, GE abandoned the proposed merger and as a result, U.S. consumers will be able to save hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The second <b>John Marshall Award for Trial of Litigation </b>is presented to the team responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Jeffrey Sterling. As a result of their tireless efforts over the course of several years, Sterling was found guilty of unauthorized disclosures of classified information vital to national security in the first Espionage Act trial of its kind in decades. The successful outcome was the result of over four years of complex pre-trial litigation involving classified information, covert witnesses, First Amendment issues and media subpoenas. At trial, the prosecutors proved that Sterling, a former CIA officer, disclosed to a journalist the details of an extremely sensitive, valuable and classified clandestine operation designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Sterlings crime not only undermined a valuable tool to attack Irans nuclear program, but also endangered the lives of an important human asset and his family. The defendants unlawful disclosures put lives at risk and constituted an egregious breach of the public trust. Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison. This case demonstrates the perseverance, tenacity and commitment of the prosecution team in overcoming formidable challenges in bringing this uniquely complex case to trial in the interests of justice and national security. Award recipients include, from the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section, Deputy Chief <b>Eric G. Olshan</b>; and from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. Attorney <b>Dennis M. Fitzpatrick</b> and Senior Litigation Counsel <b>James L. Trump</b>.</p>

<p>The first <b>John Marshall Award for Participation in Litigation</b> is presented to, from the Civil Rights Division, Office of the Assistant Attorney General Senior Counsel <b>Regina Kline</b>, Acting Chief of the Policy and Strategy Section <b>Sheila M. Foran</b>, Disability Rights Section Trial Attorneys <b>Nicholas C. Lee</b> and <b>H. Justin Park</b> and Housing and Civil Enforcement Section Trial Attorney <b>Max P. Lapertosa</b>; and from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the District of Oregon, Assistant U.S. Attorney <b>Adrian L. Brown</b>. This team is honored for its extraordinary work in securing  alongside private plaintiffs  the landmark settlement agreement remedying systemic discrimination in Oregons employment service system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). Through the teams outstanding oral and written advocacy, a groundbreaking settlement was achieved in Lane v. Brown, the nations first class-action lawsuit to challenge a state funded and administered employment service system, relying primarily on sheltered workshops, as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Acts (ADA) integration mandate. Throughout the more than three-year litigation, the team demonstrated exemplary dedication, as well as outstanding advocacy and strategy, that successfully positioned the department and private plaintiffs to obtain a comprehensive settlement agreement providing relief to approximately 7,000 people with I/DD. These individuals include 1,115 adults with I/DD, who have been relegated for far too long in segregated sheltered workshops when they were able and wanted to work in real jobs in the community, and roughly 4,900 youth with I/DD who will now receive employment services to choose, prepare for, get and keep jobs in a typical setting. The teams accomplishment serves as a model for integrated employment of persons with disabilities nationwide.</p>

<p>The second <b>John Marshall Award for Participation in Litigation</b> recognizes Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Lara K. Eshkenazi</b> and <b>Jeffrey K. Powell</b> of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York. As a result of the extraordinary work of the recipients, New York Citys jail system is now subject to sweeping court-ordered reforms to counter the pervasive culture of violence that has plagued it for decades and has inflicted tremendous harm on inmates and correction officers alike. After its rigorous investigation into the treatment of adolescent inmates on Rikers Island, the team drafted a scathing 79-page report that concluded that male inmates between the ages of 16 and 18 were subject to rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by correction staff, were not being adequately protected from violence inflicted by other inmates, and were being placed in punitive segregation for weeks or months at a time at an alarming rate. To force desperately needed reforms, the Southern District of New York intervened in an ongoing class action alleging a system-wide pattern and practice of excessive force. The recipients led the parties through many months of difficult negotiations which resulted in a groundbreaking consent decree requiring comprehensive and innovative reform designed to end the unconstitutional violence on Rikers Island. The consent decree also prohibits the use of punitive segregation for inmates under the age of 18. In approving the settlement, the district court judge described the agreement as the product of unprecedented analysis, investigation, collaboration, commitment to the protection of rights and vision for systemic reform, and noted that it provides an important example for other correctional systems throughout the country.</p>

<p>The first <b>John Marshall Award for Support of Litigation </b>is presented to Assistant Director <b>Reginald T. Blades Jr.</b> and Assistant Director <b>L. Misha Preheim</b> of the Civil Divisions Commercial Litigation Branch  National Courts Section for their outstanding and successful resolution of over 3,000 claims for back pay for certain cost of living adjustments withheld by Congress brought by Article III and non-Article III judges and their beneficiaries. The creative and innovative web-based claims process developed and implemented by the recipients has contributed greatly to the departments fair, just and efficient resolution of complex and unwieldy putative class action claims brought against the United States in 15 different lawsuits filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.</p>

<p>The second <b>John Marshall Award for Support of Litigation</b> recognizes the Environment and Natural Resources Divisions Pacific Salmon Team for its tireless and outstanding provision of litigation support in multiple cases involving salmon in the Pacific Northwest. Salmon are iconic to the Pacific Northwest and litigation over this important natural resource abounds. The recipients are responsible for representing several federal agencies in many pieces of complex litigation in federal district courts throughout the region. In this role, the team provides all aspects of legal assistance including counsel to eight federal agencies; legal review of agency actions in advance of litigation; marshalling expert witness resources and testimony; researching and drafting extensive legal briefs; coordinating positions among the various federal agencies; and representing the agencies in the courtroom. The cases are complex, controversial and often high-profile. Due to its work, the team has secured litigation outcomes allowing critical hydroelectric and navigation projects to move forward while protecting the needs of salmon. Their efforts have also resulted in significant improvement of federal and tribal relations. The awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Divisions Wildlife and Marine Resources Section, Senior Trial Attorneys <b>Michael R. Eitel</b> and <b>Carter H. Howell</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Andrea E. Gelatt</b>; and from the Environment and Natural Resources Divisions Natural Resources Section, Senior Trial Attorneys <b>Romney S. Philpott III</b> and<b>Kristofor R. Swanson</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>John Marshall Award for Handling of Appeals</b> is presented to Trial Attorney <b>Arthur T. Catterall</b> of the Tax Divisions Appellate Section. Catterall is recognized for his exceptional work as an appellate advocate in tackling some of the most difficult civil tax cases to come before the Courts of Appeals in recent years, including tax shelter cases combining complex factual patterns with thorny issues of statutory interpretation. His collaborative work with trial and agency counsel, and his clear and eloquent arguments on behalf of the federal government, have exposed the fallacies at the heart of various abusive tax shelters and have contributed to the governments victory in the SCOTUS case US v. Gary Woods, allowing for the imposition of accuracy-related penalties in transactions lacking economic substance. His work has saved and will continue to save the government hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and has contributed to the development of the law in a manner that enhances the integrity and fairness of the federal tax system.</p>

<p>The <b>John Marshall Award for Providing Legal Advice</b> is presented to the team responsible for in reviewing executive orders and attorney general orders for form and legality. Together, the recipients ensure that the orders are lawful and presented in proper form. They perform this daunting and critical task with supreme skill, integrity and care, and frequently on an extremely short timeline. Moreover, the teams behind-the-scenes work is critical to the integrity and success of every order the President of the United States or Attorney General signs. The recipients are, from the Office of Legal Counsel, Special Counsel <b>Rosemary A. Hart</b>, Senior Counsel <b>Matthew D. Roberts</b> and Attorney-Advisers <b>Martine E. Cicconi</b>, <b>Kirti Datla</b>, <b>Nathan A. Forrester</b>, <b>Laura E. Heim</b>, <b>KelleyBrooke Hostetler</b>, <b>Jane E. Nitze</b>, <b>Annie L. Owens</b>, <b>Mitchell Reich</b> and <b>Jonathan D. Shaub</b>.</p>

<p>This years <b>John Marshall Award for Asset Forfeiture </b>is presented to, from the Criminal Divisions Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, Deputy Chief <b>Woo S. Lee</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Della Sentilles</b>; from the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, Trial Attorneys <b>Frances Chang</b> and <b>Michael J. Surgalla Jr</b>.; from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Joseph F. Minni</b> and <b>J. Alvin Stout III</b>; and from the U.S. Attorneys Office Central District of California, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Katharine Schonbachler</b> and <b>Steven R. Welk</b>.</p>

<p>This team is honored for its contributions to the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative through its civil forfeiture of bribe proceeds paid to the former President of the Republic of Korea, Chun Doo Hwan. After seizing power in 1979, Chun went on to earn a salary of approximately $20,000 per year from 1980 through 1988. When he was ultimately convicted of corruption crimes by South Korea in 1997, the trial court established that Chun had received more than $200 million in bribes during his presidency and ordered him to pay restitution in that amount. Stymied in their efforts to collect on Chuns restitution order, in 2013, Korean prosecutors turned to the department for assistance. Undaunted by the age of the evidence, the team pieced together financial and testimonial evidence sufficient to show that a portion of Chuns bribe proceeds were paid through intermediaries, transferred out of Korea in the names of shell corporations and ultimately invested into various properties in the United States. On Nov. 9, 2015, Attorney General Lynch celebrated the successful conclusion of this case by presenting the Korean Minister of Justice with an embossed copy of a forfeiture order and congratulating South Korea on having recovered more than $28.7 million as a result of the teams efforts.</p>

<p>This years <b>John Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolution </b>is presented to the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Team for the negotiation, defense and implementation of a settlement between the state of Montana, the Crow Nation and the United States that confirms the federal water rights of the Crow Nation arising from its 1868 treaty. The settlement, a decades-long effort, brings much-needed water, infrastructure and economic development to the Crow Reservation in Montana and allows the tribe to thrive on its reservation. The awardees are recognized for their creative and exemplary work in developing, negotiating and implementing a settlement approved by the Montana Legislature and subsequently ratified and altered by Congress. The team then defended the settlement in state and federal courts. Their work began with the negotiation of an agreement in the late 1990s, resolving contentious water rights issues as well as mineral severance taxation issues heard by SCOTUS. The teams successful completion of this extraordinary process makes clean drinking water, improved irrigation facilities and economic development opportunities available on the Crow Indian Reservation and confirms promises made to the Crow Nation in 1868.</p>

<p>The awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Divisions Indian Resources Section, Section Chief <b>S. Craig Alexander</b>, Assistant Section Chief <b>David W. Harder</b> and Trial Attorney <b>J. Nathanael Watson</b>; from the divisions Law and Policy Section, Attorney-Advisor <b>Stacy R. Stoller</b>; from the divisions Natural Resources Section, Trial Attorney <b>Tyler G. Bair</b>; and from the divisions Appellate Section Trial Attorney <b>John L. Smeltzer.</b></p>

<p>The <b>Attorney Generals Award for Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee </b>recognizes exceptional performance and notable accomplishments towards the departments mission by an employee with fewer than five years of federal career service.</p>

<p>The first Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to<b> </b>Criminal Division Appellate Section Attorney <b>Ross B. Goldman</b>. Goldman has proven himself to be an extraordinary and productive appellate advocate, who masterfully handles complex, large-record appeals. Although his cases have run the gamut from street crime to securities fraud, Goldman has brought his sophisticated analysis to two areas that bedevil the courts and prosecutors; insider trading, where he drafted a SCOTUS merits brief and a certiorari petition, and extraterritoriality, where, in one case, he defended the murder conviction of a Colombian national who murdered a DEA agent in Bogota and, in a second case, assisted the Solicitor General in formulating arguments on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Acts extraterritorial reach. He not only volunteers to take on extra work within the division, but he also seized the opportunity to review commutation applications filed by convicted drug traffickers because he believes so strongly in the Obama Administrations initiative to provide relief to nonviolent offenders who have already served significant prison terms. Finally, Goldman serves on the divisions Diversity Committee and mentors a minority law student. He understands the departments mission writ large and he gives his best at all times.</p>

<p>The second Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Special Agent <b>Adebowale Babarinde Alade</b> of the FBIs San Antonio Field Office. Alade was the lead investigator on a 32-month complex criminal investigation targeting the Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN), a violent transnational criminal enterprise operating in Texas with connections across the United States and overseas. With less than one year in the FBI, and still serving as a probationary agent, Alade demonstrated exceptional initiative by carefully exploiting human source information in early 2013, resulting in the identification of a key leader of the ALKN with control over operations in Texas. He determined that the ALKN was importing and distributing large quantities of narcotics from Mexico-based cartels, and was also involved in weapons trafficking with access to military-grade weapons and grenades. After obtaining Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces designation, Alade relentlessly pursued ALKNs illicit activities, ultimately targeting its command and control structure through the use of sophisticated techniques involving the interception of communications through Title III court orders. During 2014, Alade exploited intelligence derived from ALKN communications and human sources, and developed a cohesive interagency team by sharing information with law enforcement partners, resulting in a collaborative effort to target the ALKN. In October 2015, his work resulted in the indictment of 48 members of the ALKN, including its entire leadership structure in Texas, on RICO Act and drug conspiracy charges, as well as state drug violations. Alade subsequently led the multiagency enforcement operation that disrupted the ALKN, resulting in the seizure of narcotics and firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash, body armor, extensive digital devices and a wide array of ALKN paraphernalia. In conducting this investigation, Alade directly supported the departments mission by ensuring public safety against domestic and foreign threats, as well as providing leadership in preventing and controlling crime.</p>
