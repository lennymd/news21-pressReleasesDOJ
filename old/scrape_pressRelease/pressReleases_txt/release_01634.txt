NoneAccording to evidence presented during the two week trial, in 2013, Kostopoulos stopped two separate motorists in order to steal their money, in violation of the motorists rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to be free from unreasonable seizures of their property.Kostopoulos subsequently obstructed justice by making misleading statements in order to prevent the communication of information about his crimes to federal law enforcement officers.The defendant abused the power granted to him as a law enforcement officer to prey upon unsuspecting motorists for personal gain and then lied about his criminal actions to investigating detectives, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas Wheeler of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.He violated not only the law, but also the public trust.The U.S. Attorneys Office, the Department of Justice and the FBI stand committed to holding those who betray the public trust accountable for their criminal actions, while supporting the overwhelming majority of men and women who proudly uphold their duties to serve and protect the community as law-abiding police officers, said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.None
