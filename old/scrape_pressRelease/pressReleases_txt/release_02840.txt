NoneChristopher Chamberlin, a tax return preparer in De Kalb, Mississippi, has prepared income tax returns for customers that fraudulently overstate the customers refunds, according to a civil complaint filed by the Justice Department today. The complaint asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to permanently bar Chamberlin from preparing tax returns for anyone other than himself.According to the complaint, Chamberlin is the sole proprietor of C&T Services LLC, located in De Kalb. The complaint alleges that Chamberlin prepared returns that fraudulently overstated refunds by reporting fictitious or exaggerated expenses on Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship) and Schedule F, Profit or Loss from Farming. The falsely claimed Schedule C and Schedule F expenses in turn generated losses that purportedly qualified Chamberlins customers to receive or increase the earned income tax credit (EITC) or to otherwise create or maximize refunds, according to the complaint. Based on audit adjustments the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made to tax returns prepared and filed by Chamberlin for tax years 2012 and 2013, the suit alleges, the United States estimates that the defendants conduct may have cost the U.S. Treasury over $1 million for those years alone.None
