A federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana has permanently barred Tiga Bryant from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. In its complaint, the government alleged that Tiga Bryant of New Orleans, Louisiana, sometimes doing business as Densons Fast Tax Services, fraudulently reduced her customers tax liabilities by improperly claiming bogus deductions and fuel tax credits. Bryant agreed to the civil injunction order entered against her, which requires her to turn over to the United States a list of all persons for whom she prepared federal tax returns since 2014. The court also authorized the United States to monitor Bryants compliance with the terms of the injunction. The governments complaint alleged that Bryant claimed false employee business expense deductions that improperly reduced her customers taxable income. In more than one example, the complaint alleged that Bryant claimed a customer incurred employee business expenses totaling slightly less than half the wages the customer earned in that particular year. According to the complaint, Bryant even claimed that one of her customers had incurred employee business expenses totaling more than the wages the employee earned in that year. In each of these instances, the customers did not actually incur the expenses Bryant reported on the return, according to the complaint. None According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited 197 returns prepared by Bryant and determined that Bryant claimed credits and/or deductions her customers were not entitled to take on 96 percent (189) of these returns and understated their tax liabilities by more than $800,000.
