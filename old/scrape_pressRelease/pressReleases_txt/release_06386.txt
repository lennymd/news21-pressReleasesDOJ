A federal grand jury in Milwaukee has returned an 11-count superseding indictment adding David B. Moore, 45, as a defendant in the federal sex trafficking case involving his son, Najee Moore, 22. Both men are charged with conspiracy to engage in the sex trafficking and forced labor of a minor and sex trafficking of a minor. David Moore is also charged with soliciting his son to engage in sex trafficking. Najee Moore is charged with an additional conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking and forced labor, two counts of sex trafficking of an adult, attempted sex trafficking of a minor, attempted forced labor, evidence tampering and attempted witness tampering. The previous indictment in the case, returned on June 18, 2013, charged only Najee Moore with sex trafficking, attempted forced labor and related offenses. According to the superseding indictment, between February 2008 and December 2009 David Moore and Najee Moore conspired to compel a minor to engage in prostitution and strip club dancing and caused that minor to engage in acts of prostitution. In July 2011, David Moore allegedly solicited his son to engage in further acts of sex trafficking. Between 2011 and 2013, Najee Moore allegedly engaged in the conduct charged in the remaining counts. Both Moores face a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. An indictment is merely an accusation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.The case is being investigated by the FBI, the Milwaukee Police Department, DHS Homeland Security Investigations and the Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation. The case is being jointly prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karine Moreno-Taxman and Trial Attorney Daniel H.Weiss of the Civil Rights Division's Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit.
