None   We are committed to pursuing contractors who fail to accurately bill the government, said Stuart F. Delery, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. The Justice Department will continue to ensure that those who do business with the government do so honestly and fairly and uphold the integrity of our public contracting process.   No government contract is more important than one that supports the security efforts of our nation overseas, said John Walsh, U. S. Attorney for the District of Colorado. When a contractor fails to bill by the contract rules set up to protect American taxpayers, our office will diligently and aggressively seek to recover any losses, as this case demonstrates.None   This settlement was the result of a coordinated effort by the Department of Justices Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch; the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Colorado and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
