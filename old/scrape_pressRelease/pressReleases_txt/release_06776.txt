  The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that Gurmail Singh, of Richmond Hill, N.Y., was arrested yesterday following his indictment on July 11, 2013, for multiple tax crimes. The indictment was unsealed yesterday following his arrest.   According to the indictment, Singh owned Fancy and Vicky Construction Co. Inc., a construction company in Richmond Hill. As alleged in the indictment, Singh used check-cashing services to cash more than $2.9 million of checks paid to his construction company for services between 2006 and 2008. He concealed his check-cashing activities from his tax return preparers, and this income was not included as gross income on the companys tax returns. Singh also diverted cash receipts earned by his companies for his own personal use.   The indictment alleges that Singh filed false 2006 and 2007 corporate income tax returns for Fancy and Vicky Construction, failed to file a 2008 corporate income tax return for Fancy and Vicky Construction and failed to file individual income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. Singh faces a potential maximum sentence of nine years in prison and a potential fine of up to $800,000.   A trial date has not been scheduled. An indictment merely alleges that a crime has been committed, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. None
