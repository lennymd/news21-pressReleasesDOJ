      WASHINGTON    Christopher Drotleff, 31, of Virginia Beach, Va., was sentenced today to 37 months in prison for his role in shooting and killing an Afghan national while on an unauthorized convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on May 5, 2009, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride of the Eastern District of Virginia and James W. McJunkin, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office.  U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar also ordered Drotleff to serve three years of supervised release following his prison term.       On March 11, 2011, Drotleff and Justin Cannon, 29, of Corpus Christi, Texas, were convicted of involuntary manslaughter while working as contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense in Afghanistan.   Cannon and Drotleff were acquitted of other charges, including second-degree murder, assault resulting in serious bodily injury and firearms offenses. Cannon is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27, 2011.       Mr. Drotleffs criminal conduct led to a tragic loss of innocent life, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. We hope that todays sentence will bring some measure of comfort to the victims families. Reckless violence by those who are employed by our armed forces abroad endangers the lives of innocent civilians and undermines the trust that our international partners have placed in our military efforts. Mr. Drotleffs conduct stands in stark contrast to the actions of the many brave men and women who serve this country honorably.       Christopher Drotleff recklessly fired his nine millimeter pistol at unarmed Afghan civilians, killing two people and shattering the lives of many more, said U.S. Attorney MacBride. General Petraeus reminded us that Mr. Drotleffs senseless killing not only took innocent lives but also seriously harmed our mission in Afghanistan and put the lives of American military and civilians in danger. The jurys verdict and todays sentence shows that no one is above the law  even in a combat zone  and that the reckless use of force will be punished.       International investigations are very complex, frequently dangerous and take a tremendous amount of dedication and effort on the part of our Special Agents, said Assistant Director in Charge McJunkin of the FBIs Washington Field Office.   The FBI in general and the Washington Field Office in particular, is both willing and able to deploy anywhere in the world to investigate violations of U.S. law no matter where they occur or who commits them. NoneNone       According to court records, as contractors, Cannon and Drotleff provided training to the Afghan National Army for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the use and maintenance of weapons and weapons systems.        The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Robert McGovern of the Criminal Divisions Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Randy C. Stoker and Alan M. Salsbury from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia - Norfolk Division. The case was investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command.
