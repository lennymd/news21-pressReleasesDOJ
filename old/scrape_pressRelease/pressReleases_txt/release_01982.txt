A British futures trader pleaded guilty today to U.S. fraud and spoofing charges in connection with an over five-year scheme to defraud, which included his role in the May 6, 2010, Flash Crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 600 points in five minutes, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Anderson of the FBIs Chicago Field Office and Director Aitan Goelman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Division of Enforcement.Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, of Hounslow, United Kingdom, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of spoofing before U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall of the Northern District of Illinois. Saro was extradited to the United States on Nov. 7 and made his first court appearance today. Navinder Sarao abused sophisticated technology to make a quick profit, and jeopardized the integrity of U.S. financial markets, said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. By flooding the marketplace with bogus orders, his scheme victimized countless individuals. Our success in bringing Sarao to justice in the United States shows that the Criminal Division will root out complex financial fraud and manipulation of the financial markets no matter where the perpetrators are located.NoneNone
