  WASHINGTON - A federal judge in St. George, Utah, has permanently enjoined Kent Bickmore, the founder of a so-called asset-protection business, from helping customers file fraudulent liens and create hidden nominee bank accounts, the Justice Department announced today. Bickmore agreed to the injunction without admitting the governments allegations.  The governments complaint alleged that Bickmore of St. George, Utah, operated the now-defunct Asset Protection Plus Inc., which helped customers place sham liens on their property to deceive creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service. Bickmore and Asset Protection also allegedly helped customers hide their income and assets by holding their money in bank accounts under nominee names.None
