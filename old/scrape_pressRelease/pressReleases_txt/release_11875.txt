None  "Given the parties express commitment to ongoing discussions to address concerns already raised and the possibility that such discussions could lead to a settlement agreement that could legally be approved by the Court, the public interest would best be served by direction from the Court encouraging the continuation of those discussions between the parties and, if the Court so chooses, by some direction as to those aspects of the Proposed Settlement that need to be improved. Because a properly structured settlement agreement in this case offers the potential for important societal benefits, the United States does not want the opportunity or momentum to be lost."  In its filing, the Department proposed that the parties consider a number of changes to the agreement that may help address the United States concerns, including imposing limitations on the most open-ended provisions for future licensing, eliminating potential conflicts among class members, providing additional protections for unknown rights holders, addressing the concerns of foreign authors and publishers, eliminating the joint-pricing mechanisms among publishers and authors, and, whatever the settlements ultimate scope, providing some mechanism by which Googles competitors can gain comparable access.  The settlement agreement between Google and the authors and publishers aims to resolve copyright infringement claims brought against Google by the Authors Guild and five major publishers in 2005 raised by Googles efforts to digitally scan books contained in several libraries and make them searchable on the Internet. The District Courts hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled to take place on October 7, 2009.NoneNone
