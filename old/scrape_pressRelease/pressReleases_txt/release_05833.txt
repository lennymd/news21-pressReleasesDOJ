      Baptist Health System Inc. (Baptist Health), the parent company for a network of affiliated hospitals and medical providers in the Jacksonville, Florida, area, has agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle allegations that its subsidiaries violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims to federal health care programs for medically unnecessary services and drugs, the Department of Justice announced today. The alleged misconduct involved Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.        Providers that bill for unnecessary services and drugs contribute to the soaring cost of health care, said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division Stuart F. Delery. Providers must deal fairly and honestly with federal health care programs, and the Justice Department will investigate aggressively and hold accountable those who do not.        This settlement resolves allegations that, from September 2009 to October 2011, two neurologists in the Baptist Health network misdiagnosed patients with various neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, which caused Baptist Health to bill for medically unnecessary services. Although Baptist Health placed one of the physicians at issue on administrative leave in October 2011, it did not disclose any misdiagnoses to the government until September 2012.        This settlement sends a clear message that health care fraud will not be tolerated in our district, particularly when there is the potential for harm to patients, said U.S. Attorney A. Lee Bentley III for the Middle District of Florida.       The improper conduct at issue in this case included Medicaid patients. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the federal government. The state of Florida, which paid for some of the Medicaid claims at issue, will receive $19,024 of the settlement amount. NoneNoneNoneNone      These health care providers did not only violate the laws of the United States - they violated the trust placed in them by their patients, said Inspector General of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Patrick E. McFarland. Federal employees deserve health care providers,including hospitals, that meet the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior. Today's settlement remindsall providersthat they must observe those standards and reflects the commitment of federal law enforcement organizations to pursue improper and illegal conduct that may put the health and well-being of their patients at risk.None      This settlement illustrates the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in   May 2009 by Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $19.1 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $13.6 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.  None      This settlement is the result of a coordinated effort among the Justice Departments Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Defense Health Agency Program Integrity Office and the Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General.NoneNone
