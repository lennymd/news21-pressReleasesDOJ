The Justice Department announced today that it reached a settlement with the operators of Pikes Peak Wrestling League, a youth wrestling league that serves approximately 4,000 children across the state of Colorado, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The settlement resolves allegations that Pikes Peak Youth Sports Association LLC and Peak Youth Sports Association violated the ADA by failing to modify their policies, practices or procedures to allow a child who has dwarfism to play down one age division at the 2014 Colorado State Wrestling Championship so that he could compete with wrestlers closer to his weight and size. The agreement was filed today as a proposed consent decree, which must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, along with a complaint.Under the agreement, the wrestling league will adopt and publicize a disability nondiscrimination policy, including procedures for handling requests to modify policies for wrestlers with disabilities. The league will train employees on ADA requirements and invite coaches affiliated with Pikes Peak Wrestling League and USA Wrestling Directors to attend this training, free of charge. In addition, the wrestling league will pay compensatory damages to the child identified in the complaint and report to the department on its compliance with the agreement.NoneNoneNone
