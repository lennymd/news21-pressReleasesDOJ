Conrad Jr. of the Western District of North Carolina. The 48-month sentence will run consecutive to the previously-issued 60-month sentence. Brown pleaded guilty on June 1, 2016, to one count of failure to surrender for service of sentence and one count of contempt of court.As part of her guilty plea, Brown admitted that she violated her court-ordered release conditions by removing her location monitor and using an unlawfully-obtained passport to flee to Canada after having been ordered to surrender for a 60-month prison sentence stemming from her role in managing an illegal call center in Costa Rica that defrauded hundreds of U.S. victims. Brown further admitted that she fled to Canada with the intent of avoiding her sentence.This case was investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations and Department of State.
