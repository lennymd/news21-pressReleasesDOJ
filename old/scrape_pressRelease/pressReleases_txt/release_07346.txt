    A federal grand jury in Muskogee, Okla., has indicted Dennis Frisbie Jr., 32, a former detention officer at the Muskogee County Jail (MCJ), on one count of making material false statements to the FBI.       According to the indictment, Frisbie   falsely reported to the FBI that he had been shot by an unknown individual on or about July 9, 2011, and that he believed he was shot because he had previously been interviewed and cooperated with the FBI regarding an investigation into matters at the MCJ.  The indictment alleges that this statement was false because   Frisbie knew at the time of his statement to the FBI that he had not been shot by an unknown individual because of his previous cooperation with the FBI.       Frisbie faces a maximum penalty of five years for making material false statements to the FBI.     An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.       This case is being investigated by the Muskogee Resident Agency of the Oklahoma City Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Fara Gold and Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
