    The Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) announced that Matthew Bender, of Detroit, was convicted yesterday following a jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan of failing to appear at a bond hearing on July 2, 2013. The bond hearing had been set to adjudicate Bender's noncompliance with the conditions of his pretrial release on federal tax charges.     The evidence at trial showed that Bender attended a family reunion in Ohio and flew to Texas in the summer of 2013 after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Bender was apprehended by the U.S. Marshals Service on Aug. 13, 2013. None     Following the most recent conviction, Bender remains detained pending sentencing for his convictions.      The case was investigated by special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation and TIGTA. Trial Attorneys Kenneth Vert and Jeffrey McLellan for the Justice Departments Tax Division prosecuted the case.
