      WASHINGTON  Eddye Lovely of Tomball, Texas, pleaded guilty today to three counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.  Lovely appeared before U.S. District Judge Nancy F. Atlas in Houston.        According to the plea agreement, Lovely owned and operated a Houston return preparation business, called The Tax Master, at which he prepared false income tax returns that included certain false Schedule A itemized deductions that the client did not make and fraudulent Schedule C business losses that the clients did not operate.         After Lovely was indicted in April 2011 on 14 counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, he persisted in the preparation of false tax returns despite a court order requiring him not to prepare any tax returns while on release in the case. According to the plea agreement, after his release, Lovely aided and assisted in the preparation of materially false 2010 tax returns for two additional clients. These tax returns were materially false in that they featured fabricated Schedule C losses for businesses that the taxpayers did not own or operate, as well as false or inflated Schedule A deductions for charitable contributions and/or job search costs.         The tax loss associated with the three counts to which Lovely pleaded guilty is $74,964.  Lovely faces a maximum prison sentence of nine years and a fine of up to $750,000.  Judge Atlas set sentencing for Feb. 29, 2012.       The case was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation and prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Tracy Gostyla and Kathryn Ward of the Justice Departments Tax Division. None
