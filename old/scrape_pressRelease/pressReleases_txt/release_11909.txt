  WASHINGTON The Department of Justice announced today that it will not challenge a proposal by Memorial Health Inc. (Memorial), and St. Josephs/Candler Health System (St. Josephs/Candler) to enter an exclusive joint purchasing agreement with respect to the purchase of certain medical and surgical supplies. The Department said that the proposed joint purchasing agreement may yield volume discounts and reduced transaction costs for the hospitals and ultimately could result in lower costs and increased hospital services for consumers.  Under the proposed agreement, Memorial and St. Josephs/Candler would jointly evaluate medical and surgical products, designate suppliers and negotiate prices and other terms with them.  Memorial and St. Josephs/Candler are 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations that own acute tertiary care hospitals in Savannah, Ga., that serve Southeast Georgia and the low-country area of South Carolina. Memorial owns and operates the Memorial Health University Medical Center. St. Josephs/Candler owns and operates St. Josephs Hospital and Candler Hospital.None  Under the Departments business review procedure, an organization may submit a proposed action to the Antitrust Division and receive a statement as to whether the Division currently intends to challenge the action under the antitrust laws.  A file containing the business review request and the Departments response may be examined in the Antitrust Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Suite 1010, Washington, D.C. 20530. After a 30-day waiting period, the documents supporting the business review will be added to the file, unless a basis for their exclusion for reasons of confidentiality has been established under the Business Review Procedure.
