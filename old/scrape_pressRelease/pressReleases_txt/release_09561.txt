NoneNone    As a result of the Antitrust Divisions investigation into fraud and anticompetitive conduct in the E-Rate program, a total of seven companies and 24 individuals have pleaded guilty, been convicted at trial or entered civil settlements. Those companies and individuals have been sentenced to pay criminal fines and restitution totaling more than $40 million. Eighteen individuals, including Sheets, have been sentenced to serve prison time.     According to the charge, Sheets violated E-Rate program rules by compensating two school districts for their share of E-Rate expenses.   In addition, Sheets utilized E-Rate funds to purchase undisclosed items, some of which were not eligible for E-Rate funding.   Sheets concealed his violation of E-Rate program rules from the E-Rate program by fraudulently misrepresenting that the schools had been billed for their E-Rate expenses when, in fact, Sheets had reimbursed the schools for their share of expenses.   The department said Sheets engaged in the wire fraud beginning in or about December 2001 and continuing until about December 2007. NoneNone
