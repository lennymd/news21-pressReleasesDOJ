Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement on the departure of U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. of the District of Columbia:During more than five years as U.S. Attorney of the District of Columbia, Ron Machen Jr. has distinguished himself as a skilled leader, a devoted public servant and a forceful champion of justice on behalf of the American people. Throughout his remarkable tenure, Ron has applied his boundless talent and consummate judgment to protect the safety and security of all Americans in cases involving violent crime, national security threats and public corruption. As one of Rons predecessors as U.S. Attorney in Washington, I know firsthand the unique demands of leading the nations largest U.S. Attorneys Office. But Ron has never been deterred by a difficult challenge, nor slowed in his pursuit of a safer, stronger Washington. I was fortunate to be able to hire Ron as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Office in 1997, and I see in him now the exceptional qualities that I saw in him then: unassailable integrity, relentless determination and a passion for law and justice. I congratulate him on the outstanding results he has achieved as U.S. Attorney of the District of Columbia. I thank him for his inspiring service. And I look forward to all that he will accomplish in the next stage of his already extraordinary career.
