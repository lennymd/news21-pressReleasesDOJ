The United States filed a complaint to permanently bar a Louisville, Kentucky, man and his business, NJ Mobile Tax Service, LLC, from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.According to the complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Kentucky, Napoleon L. Jackson has prepared federal income tax returns that improperly understated his customers income tax liabilities. According to the suit, in a flyer for NJ Mobile, Jackson, offers to travel to his customers homes and prepare their tax returns. The flyer invites potential customers to Let me do the numbers & Ill even come to you, and boasts that [Jackson] can increase your chances for a higher return.The complaint alleges that Jackson understated his customers federal tax liabilities by, among other things:Falsely claiming deductions related to home ownership for taxpayers that did not own homes, including cases where Jackson prepared and filed returns from customers rental homes;Falsely claiming dependents, including listing Jacksons relatives, as dependents on a customers tax return;Fabricating charitable contributions, and offering to falsify letters from a church that indicated the customers contributed $5,500 in cash to the church that the customers had not in fact donated; andFalsely claiming education credits for taxpayers who were not entitled to them.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited 31 tax returns that Jackson prepared on behalf of 20 customers for tax years 2010 and 2011. An examination of these 31 returns resulted in an increase in taxes owed for every return, according to the suit. The complaint further alleges that Jackson prepared at least 162 returns from 2010 to 2011, and continues to prepare returns today. Overall, the suit alleges that Jacksons conduct may have cost the U.S. Treasury more than $800,000.None
