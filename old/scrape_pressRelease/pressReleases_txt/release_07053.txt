The Department of Justice today announced that a federal grand jury sitting in Milwaukee has indicted Najee C. Moore, 22, on charges of conspiracy, sex trafficking and attempted forced labor, of both minor and adult victims. The indictment alleges that Moore engaged in the sex trafficking of two different minor victims in 2010 and 2012, respectively, and used force, fraud, and coercion to compel both adult and minor victims to engage in commercial sex acts. The indictment further charges the defendant with conspiring and attempting to compel a victim into forced labor. The matter is being investigated by the FBI, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, Milwaukee Police Department and the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karine Moreno-Taxman of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin and Trial Attorney Daniel H. Weiss of the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the subject is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.
