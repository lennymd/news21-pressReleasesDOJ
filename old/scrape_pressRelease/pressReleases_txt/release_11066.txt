WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced it has filed briefs in three separate cases in Florida, Illinois and New Jersey as part of its continuing effort to enforce civil rights laws that require states to end discrimination against and unnecessary segregation of persons with disabilities. The departments filings support two private lawsuits seeking relief in Florida and New Jersey, as well as a proposed statewide class action settlement in Illinois.None"As the Supreme Court determined in the landmark Olmstead decision, unjustified institutionalization violates the rights of individuals with disabilities and stigmatizes them as unworthy of participation in community life," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "Florida, Illinois and New Jersey can provide community-based services to people with disabilities, and the law requires them to do so to prevent unnecessary institutionalization."NoneNoneNoneNone
