  The government has intervened in a lawsuit against CH2M Hill Hanford Group Inc. (CH2M Hill) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, the Department of Justice announced today.   CH2M Hill is a subsidiary of CH2M Hill Companies Ltd., a Colorado-based engineering and construction services company.      Between 1999 and 2008, CH2M Hill was a U.S. Department of Energy prime contractor responsible for the management and cleanup of over 170 underground storage tanks containing mixed radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energys Hanford Nuclear Site in southeastern Washington.     The lawsuit filed by Mr. Schroeder alleges that numerous CH2M Hill hourly employees regularly and substantially overstated the number of hours that they worked.   The complaint also alleges that CH2M Hill management knowingly condoned this practice and submitted inflated claims to the Department of Energy that included the fraudulently claimed hours.      Eight former CH2M Hill employees, including Mr. Schroeder, have pleaded guilty to felony charges stemming from the time card fraud.  The lawsuit was originally filed under the False Claims Act by Carl Schroeder, a former employee of CH2M Hill.   NoneNone  The claims asserted in this case are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.   The case is being handled by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington, with the assistance of the Department of Energy Office of Inspector General.
