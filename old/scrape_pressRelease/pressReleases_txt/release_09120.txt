NoneNoneNone  These defendants allegedly invested significant time and energy in subterfuge to conceal their ill gotten government funds. Money laundering is a critical part of large scale health care fraud schemes and often the most difficult piece to unravel. Law enforcement will not be deterred by the schemes and evasions used to hide these proceeds of fraud. We will follow the money and bring to justice all who would engage in financial transactions designed to disguise the proceeds of Medicare fraud, stated Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Ms. Lynch expressed her grateful appreciation to the FBI and HHS-OIG, the agencies responsible for leading the governments investigation, and thanked the New York State Attorney Generals Office for its assistance.   What all these criminal schemes have in common is the exploitation of Medicare, said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Janice K. Fedarcyk. A program to help seniors manage the costs of health care was here abused to line the pockets of unscrupulous doctors and others. Medicare and Medicaid are taxpayer funded, so the outrageous conduct of these defendants victimized everyone. The FBI is committed to policing health care fraud, to catch the crooks and to rein in costs.   Physical therapy fraud and illegal financial kickbacks remain a problem in the Brooklyn area, said Thomas ODonnell, Special Agent in Charge of the HHS-Office of Inspector Generals (OIG) New York Region. So, along with federal and state law enforcement partners, we will target these and similar schemes that divert valuable, scarce Medicare funds. NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
