NoneAccording to documents filed with the court, Yaowapha Ritdet, 56, hired Thai nationals who were illegally present in the United States to work at her restaurants, Ruen Tong Thai Cuisine and Walter Caf, both located in Ukiah. Ritdet underpaid these employees and instructed them not to speak to anyone about their immigration status. Ritdet also paid her employees in cash and did not pay employment taxes on the cash wages. Ritdet filed false individual income tax returns for 2007 through 2011 that underreported the gross receipts, sales, and income she received from her two restaurants, and failed to report rental income and a foreign bank account she held in Thailand. In addition to the term of prison imposed, Ritdet was ordered to serve three years of supervised release and to pay approximately $567,755.65 in restitution to include $70,768.65 to underpaid employees and $496,987 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ritdet pleaded guilty in August 2016.None None
