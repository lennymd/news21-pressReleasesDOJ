Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on the planned departure of U.S. Attorney John P. Fishwick Jr. of the Western District of Virginia:Since 2015, U.S. Attorney John P. Fishwick Jr. has served the people of the Western District of Virginia, and the people of this nation, with integrity and distinction. During Johns tenure as U.S. Attorney, his office made significant progress on many of the difficult challenges facing law enforcement today. Under his leadership, the Western District successfully prosecuted the gang responsible for the murder of a police captain, collaborated with local and state law enforcement officials to fight the scourge of gun violence and tirelessly combated the heroin epidemic. And John personally promoted strong relationships between law enforcement and the community. Among other initiatives, John educated youth about gun violence and drug addiction, and introduced a mentoring program that links law enforcement mentors  such as John  with the young people of Roanoke. I want to thank John for his service, and I wish him the very best in the next phase of his career.
