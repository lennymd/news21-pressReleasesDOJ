  Jaime Viteri, a Chicago  businessman, pleaded guilty to two counts of willfully failing to file federal  individual income tax returns today, announced the Justice Department and the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).   On June 12, a criminal  information was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois that alleged Viteri had willfully failed to file individual income tax  returns for tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009.  According to the plea agreement  filed with the district court, Viteri earned and received gross income from his  work as the president and chief executive officer of Viteri Inc., doing business  as Chicago Latino Network (CLN), a solely owned media company focused on the  Latino community in Chicago.  Viteri was also an employee and managing director  of the Bureau of Entrepreneurship and Small Business at the Department of  Commerce and Economic Opportunity, an Illinois state government agency.   Viteris gross income from his  employment exceeded approximately $270,000 for the 2008 tax year and $290,000  for the 2009 tax year.  During these years, Viteri was required to file  individual income tax returns and report the gross income he earned.  Despite  earning and receiving gross income from two different sources, Viteri willfully  failed to file individual income tax returns with the IRS for tax years 2008 and  2009 as required by law.  Under the terms of the plea agreement, Viteri also  agrees to pay restitution to the IRS.   Sentencing is scheduled for Nov.  5, 2014.  Viteri faces a statutory maximum sentence of one year in prison per  count, one year of supervised release per count and a maximum fine of $100,000  per count.   The case was investigated by  special agents from IRS-Criminal Investigation and prosecuted by Trial Attorney  Christopher Maietta of the Justice Departments Tax Division. None
