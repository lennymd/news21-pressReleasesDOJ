The Justice Department today announced that two former Tuskegee Police Department lieutenants, Alex Huntley, 53, and Darian Locure, 44, have been indicted by a federal grand jury for their roles in the beating of an arrestee and an attempted cover-up.  The five-count indictment charges that on or about Dec. 24, 2014, Huntley physically assaulted an arrestee, while Locure willfully failed to intervene to stop Huntleys assault. The assault caused the arrestee to suffer bodily injuries.  Huntley and Locure are also charged with directing and encouraging other Tuskegee Police Department officers and recruits who witnessed the assault to keep it a secret. Finally, the indictment charges that Huntley gave false testimony under oath about the assault in a state court proceeding regarding criminal charges against the arrestee.  This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Alabama State Bureau of Investigation has also assisted the investigation. The matter is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Samantha Trepel of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and Assistant United States Attorney Denise Simpson of the United States Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Alabama. The charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.
