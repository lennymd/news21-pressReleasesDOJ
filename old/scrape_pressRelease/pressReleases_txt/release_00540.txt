When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the publics safety at risk. San Franciscos decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle. While the State of California sought a murder charge for the man who caused Ms. Steinles deatha man who would not have been on the streets of San Francisco if the city simply honored an ICE detainerthe people ultimately convicted him of felon in possession of a firearm. The Department of Justice will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens. I urge the leaders of the nations communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.
