  Attorney General Eric Holder announced today that he has appointed Gary Grindler Acting Deputy Attorney General, effective Feb. 5, 2010. Grindler will become Acting Deputy Attorney General upon the departure of Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, who announced his resignation effective Feb. 5.  "Gary is a great asset to the Department, and I am pleased he has agreed to take on this responsibility," Attorney General Eric Holder said. "He will be instrumental in our work to keep the American people safe, ensure the fairness and integrity of our financial markets, and restore the traditional missions of the Department."  "I am honored to serve the American people in this new capacity," Grindler said. "I look forward to assisting the Attorney General in moving the Department forward."  Grindler will serve until Feb. 5 as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. He rejoined the Department in March as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division. He returned to the Department after previously serving in a number of roles, including as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General and Counselor to the Attorney General, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division, and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of Georgia.  Most recently, Grindler was a partner at King & Spalding LLP in its Washington, D.C., office where he focused on white collar criminal defense, internal corporate investigations and complex civil litigation. He was selected for inclusion in the 2006-2009 editions of The Best Lawyers in America in the area of white collar criminal defense and on the 2008-2009 Washington, D.C., Super Lawyers lists. In 2000, he received the Edmund J. Randolph Award in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the Department of Justice. He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from Northwestern University.
