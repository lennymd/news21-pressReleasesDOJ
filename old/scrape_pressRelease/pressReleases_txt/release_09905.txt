        WASHINGTON  A Chicago grand jury returned an indictment today against two former executives of Paris-based   Socit Air France (Air France), for participating in a conspiracy to fix and coordinate surcharges on air cargo shipments to and from the United States and elsewhere and air cargo service rates to certain locations in the United States and elsewhere, the Department of Justice announced today.  The indictment further alleges that the former executives along with co-conspirators also agreed to refuse to pay their customers commissions on surcharges for air cargo shipments to and from the United States and elsewhere.   None         Air cargo carriers transport a variety of cargo shipments, such as heavy equipment, perishable commodities and consumer goods, on scheduled international flights.       According to the indictment, Boudier, Foucault and co-conspirators carried out the conspiracy by participating in or directing the participation of subordinate employees in meetings, conversations and communications to discuss rates for air cargo shipments to certain U.S. locations and elsewhere and surcharges for air cargo shipments to and from the United States and elsewhere.  The department said, in accordance with the agreement and understanding reached by Boudier, Foucault and co-conspirators, they issued announcements of increases on surcharges and rates.         Boudier and Foucault are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.
