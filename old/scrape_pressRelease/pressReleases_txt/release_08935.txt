      WASHINGTON  A captain in the U.S. Army pleaded guilty today in federal court in Alexandria, Va., to making more than $68,000 in false housing and travel claims, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride for the Eastern District of Virginia.      Lisa A. Dean, 38, of Alexandria, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee in the Eastern District of Virginia to a criminal information charging her with two counts of making a false claim against the United States.  According to court documents, Dean was stationed in Bamberg, Germany, from 2002 to 2010.  Dean admitted that, beginning in 2003, she submitted false housing allowance forms claiming that her dependent mother was living in San Francisco, when in fact she was living in Arizona where the housing rates were lower.   Dean admitted that from August 2006 through September 2011, she received a total of $58,167 in excess housing allowance for her mother to which she was not entitled.  Dean also admitted that in the fall of 2010, she submitted false travel vouchers claiming that she moved her mother from San Francisco to her new duty station in Alexandria, when in fact no such move occurred.  Dean was paid $10,222 as a result of the false travel vouchers.       Dean faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each offense, as well as a term of supervised release following her prison term.  Dean is also responsible for restitution in the amount of $68,389.  Sentencing has been scheduled for Feb. 17, 2012.        This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Richard B. Evans of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section and Charles F. Connolly, Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Virginia.  The case is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Command.
