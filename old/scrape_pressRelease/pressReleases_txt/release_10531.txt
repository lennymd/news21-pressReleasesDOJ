  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice announced today that another of its components, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), implemented the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS), a core centralized accounting system that improves internal controls and standardizes data.  ATF is the second department law enforcement organization to convert to UFMS as the financial system of record. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) implemented UFMS in January 2009, following a pilot deployment to the Justice Management Divisions (JMD) Asset Forfeiture Management Staff. UFMS now serves more than 2,500 Department of Justice users worldwide.  The ATF implementation was completed on schedule and on budget, employing a two-phased approach to minimize risk and capitalize on lessons learned from earlier implementations. More than 95 percent of ATFs requirements were met by the standard processes, interfaces and reports already designed and available in the departments foundation build of UFMS. As a result, the initial design and development was done on time, and deployed to many users.  The department shares the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)s goal to reduce the risks and costs of implementing federal financial management systems. The most critical department business need for core accounting functionality is delivered by UFMS, implemented in phases across components with defined milestones, the department said.  The implementation of UFMS, based on CGI Federals Momentum 6.3, is a collaborative effort by JMD and ATF with the systems integrator, IBM.None
