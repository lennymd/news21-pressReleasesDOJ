Press Secretary Dena Iverson released the following statement regarding proposed amendment 4720 to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Bill by Senator Dianne Feinstein.The Justice Department supports Senator Feinstein's amendment to help keep guns out of the hands of individuals believed to be engaged in terrorism. The amendment gives the Justice Department an important additional tool to prevent the sale of guns to suspected terrorists by licensed firearms dealers while ensuring protection of the department's operational and investigative sensitivities. We also continue to support universal background checks as a necessary tool to prevent suspected terrorists from lawfully obtaining firearms."
