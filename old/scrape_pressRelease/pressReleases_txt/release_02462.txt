The Justice Department announced today it has reached an agreement with the Omaha Performing Arts Society (OPAS) resolving an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complaint against the Orpheum Theater in Omaha, Nebraska.The department alleged that OPAS failed to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the theater provided access to individuals with disabilities as required after the theater underwent a renovation.The ADA requires that when doing renovations, public accommodations must ensure their facilities are readily accessible and fully usable by people with disabilities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We commend the Omaha Performing Arts Society for cooperating with the Justice Department and taking quick action to implement the necessary reforms.The ADA requires alterations of existing theaters to comply with certain ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Under the settlement agreement, OPAS will provide 20 wheelchair and companion seating locations and 20 designated aisle accessible seats dispersed throughout the theater. OPAS will also install a permanent lift to provide an accessible route from the orchestra floor to the stage floor and it will revise its ticketing and pricing policies to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to purchase accessible seats.NoneNone
