    A federal grand jury in Montgomery, Ala., returned an indictment charging Scottie Alice Johnson with a conspiracy to commit theft of public funds and to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and with theft of public funds, the Justice Department and the IRS announced today.       According to the indictment, between 2006 and 2012, Johnson conspired with others to defraud the IRS and commit theft of public funds.  Co-conspirators filed false federal income tax returns with stolen identities and had refunds directly deposited into several bank accounts, including bank accounts in the name of Scottie Alice Johnson and another individual. The bank accounts associated with the conspiracy received at least $1.3 million in false tax refunds.       An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, Johnson faces five years in prison for the conspiracy count and 10 years in prison for each theft of public funds count.  Johnson is also subject to fines, mandatory restitution and forfeiture.      The case was investigated by Special Agents of the IRS - Criminal Investigation.  Trial attorneys Jason H. Poole and Michael Boteler of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Brown are prosecuting the case. None
