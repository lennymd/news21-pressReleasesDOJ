Attorney General Jeff Sessions released the following statement on the FBIs announcement of the 2016 Hate Crimes Statistics: No person should have to fear being violently attacked because of who they are, what they believe, orhow they worship. In June, the Hate Crimes Subcommittee of the Justice Departments Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety met with representatives from affected communities. The subcommittee continues to explore ways to expand and improve training for federal, state, and local prosecutors and investigators; improve data collection of hate crimes; and to create even better partnerships with local law enforcement and affected communities.  The full report of the Task Force is due in January, but there are actions we can take now, like continuing to aggressively prosecute those who violate an individuals civil rights. Most recently, the Justice Department cross-designated a Civil Rights Division prosecutor to assist in the trial of an Iowa man accused of murdering Kedarie Johnson, a transgender teenager. I was pleased to learn on November 3, 2017 that the trial resulted in a conviction, and the man now faces life in prison. The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that individuals can live without fear of being a victim of violent crime based on who they are, what they believe, or how they worship.
