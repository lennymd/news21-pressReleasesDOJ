      WASHINGTON  Julius Everett Bud Johnson, of Richmond, Va., pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Richmond for his role in an investment scheme resulting in millions of dollars in losses, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil H. MacBride.   None      According to court filings, from prior to July 2009 until at least March 2010, Johnson owned and operated several businesses based in Richmond, including Virginia Group Benefits; Mid-Atlantic Insurance; F.I.C. Financial Group, Inc.; Benefit Contractors Administrators Inc.; River City Cleaners LLC; Roberts Awning LLC; Norvell Awning, LLC; MHC Linen Services LLC; The Everett Group; and Living Well.  Johnson and a co-conspirator offered investments in the different businesses, generally including a promise of returns of up to 10 percent within one to four years. Johnson and his co-conspirator represented to potential investors that their investment funds would be funneled directly into specific companies, which would generate the returns on investment.  Instead, a significant portion of the invested funds were used to repay other investors and to cover operating costs for unrelated businesses.  None      The statement of facts details two separate transactions where Johnson and his co-conspirator misused investor funds.  In the summer of 2009, Johnson experienced shortages in some of his companies.  At the same time, he was approached by two investors who demanded a portion of their investments back.  With the co-conspirators assistance, Johnson obtained additional investor funds that were ultimately used to repay $125,000 to the two investors.  In a separate transaction occurring in October 2009, Johnson told his co-conspirator that he needed money to make quarterly interest payments.  The co-conspirator successfully solicited an investor for $200,000 in funds that were purportedly intended to be invested in Norvell Awning Company.  Although that money was initially deposited in the Norvell Awning bank account, the funds were depleted from that account within four days.  In reality, Johnson diverted the money to repay other investors, to cover shortfalls in other companies and to pay a $30,000 commission to Johnsons co-conspirator.         In connection with his guilty plea, Johnson stipulated that the restitution amount associated with this scheme is approximately $8.92 million.  Johnson will be ordered to repay the final restitution amount to his victims at sentencing.       This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Gill of the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Kevin Muhlendorf of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.  The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigative Division, the FBI, and the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance.  The investigation is ongoing.
