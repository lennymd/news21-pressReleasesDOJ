None   Nikbakht had pleaded guilty to tax evasion on March 30, 2011. At his plea hearing, he admitted that during 2007 he earned income through auto dealership operations, including through a dealership called Southern California Car Exchange. Nikbakht further admitted that he willfully failed to file his personal tax return and pay his taxes for 2007, and that he engaged in various acts to conceal income from the IRS.   For example, Nikbakht admitted that he operated under another dealers license and that he instructed the other dealer to write his income payment checks to the order of a third-party or to cash.   Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation, who prosecuted the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Thomas W. Flynn and Joseph A. Rillotta, who prosecuted the case. None
