    WASHINGTON  David R. Lewalski, formerly of Gainesville, Fla., pleaded guilty today to mail fraud in connection with his operation of a $30 million investment fraud scheme, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Robert E. ONeill of the Middle District of Florida.      Lewalski, 47, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark A. Pizzo in the Middle District of Florida and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. None     Lewalski admitted that instead of trading in the foreign currency market as he promised, he used the bulk of victim investor funds to make payments to other investors in order to perpetuate the scheme and make it appear as if he was generating the promised returns. Lewalski paid investors $14,339,887 in returns that he led them to believe were generated by his forex trading when, in reality, he was merely paying them with other victim investors funds. Lewalski also spent millions of dollars of victim investor funds on personal expenses, including high end real estate, private jet travel, luxury automobiles, computer equipment and jewelry.     This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mandy Riedel and Trial Attorney Henry Van Dyck of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section. The case was investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, with assistance from the Florida Office of the Attorney General.
