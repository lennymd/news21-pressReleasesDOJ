  The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that Susan C. Valentine, a resident of Fairfax County, Va., pleaded guilty today to tax evasion.   According to documents filed with the court, Valentine was the former director at the Epiphany Weekday School (EWS) in Alexandria, Va. From 2008 through 2010, Valentine received a salary and also took additional funds from EWS for herself and members of her family. Despite earning this income, Valentine did not file income tax returns or pay income taxes for 2008 through 2010. Moreover, as director, Valentine caused false payroll tax forms to be filed on behalf of ESW with the IRS.   Sentencing was scheduled by U.S. District Court Judge James Cacheris for Oct. 18, 2013. Valentine faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, three years of supervised release, a $250,000 fine and a $100 special assessment. She has agreed to pay restitution to the IRS.   Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended the efforts of special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Melissa Siskind and Karen E. Kelly, who are prosecuting the case.
