  WASHINGTON  Edward Lee Sullivan, of Oakland, Calif., was sentenced today to 300 months in prison for production and possession of child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag of the Northern District of California.  Sullivan, 39, was found guilty on Feb. 25, 2011, of one count of producing and one count of possessing child pornography after a 13-day bench trial before U.S. District Court Judge D. Lowell Jensen of the Northern District of California.  Evidence presented at trial showed that during a two-week period in March 2008, Sullivan trained a 14 year-old girl to work for him as a child prostitute. During the course of those two weeks, Sullivan produced numerous photographs and videos of the minor, which documented the steps Sullivan took to prepare the girl to work as a prostitute and as an actress in pornographic movies. According to trial evidence, Sullivan filmed at least one pornographic video of the minor, which depicted Sullivan instructing the minor as she performed oral sex on him. At the time Sullivan committed these crimes, he was on parole following a 2002 state conviction for pimping and sexual conduct with a 14 year-old girl.None
