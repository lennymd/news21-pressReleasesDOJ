The Justice Department reached an agreement today with Diversified Business Consulting Group Inc., an information technology staffing agency headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland. The settlement resolves the departments claims that Diversified discriminated against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).The departments investigation concluded that Diversifieds human resources personnel required non-U.S. citizens, but not U.S. citizens, to present specific types of documents during the employment eligibility verification process to establish their work authority. The INAs anti-discrimination provision prohibits employers from specifying documents that employees must present during the employment eligibility verification process based on an employees citizenship status or national origin.Under the settlement agreement, Diversified will pay $7,700 in civil penalties to the United States and undergo department-provided training on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA. Diversifieds corporate office and its branches will be subject to departmental monitoring and reporting requirements.The Civil Rights Division is committed to protecting work-authorized individuals from discriminatory practices in the employment eligibility verification process, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division. We commend Diversified for working cooperatively with the division to resolve this matter.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to: different documentary requirements based on their citizenship status, immigration status, or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship status, immigration status or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral, should contact OSCs worker hotline for assistance.
