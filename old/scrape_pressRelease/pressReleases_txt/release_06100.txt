The Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit today in the federal court in Nashville, Tenn., to stop Gilberto Cortes and his business, Mundo Hispano Services, from preparing federal tax returns. According to the complaint, Cortes and his business have prepared more than 7,000 tax returns since 2010.The complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee alleges that Cortes understates his customers federal tax liabilities or generates larger than warranted refunds by improperly claiming the additional child tax credit on their income tax returns. According to the complaint, thousands of Cortes customers have improperly claimed the additional child tax credit. As a result, his customers have received, on average. over $2,300 in improper benefits per return. In total, the complaint alleges that Cortes activities over the last three years have potentially cost the U.S. Treasury $12.8 million or more in lost income tax revenue.NoneRelated Materials:None
