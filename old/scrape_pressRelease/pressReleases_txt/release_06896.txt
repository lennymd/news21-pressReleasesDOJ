  The United States sued a Southlake, Texas woman last night, seeking to bar her from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction suit was filed against Karena Mondrianh in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The government complaint alleges that Mondrianh prepares fraudulent tax returns that understate customers taxable income by inventing  sometimes without the customers knowledge  false business expenses and by falsely claiming that a customers income is exempt from tax. The suit alleges that most of Mondrianhs customers work overseas for defense contractors.  The complaint further alleges that Mondrianh has provided false information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in improper attempts to delay IRS audits of customers. She allegedly urged one customer to lie to an IRS agent in order to prevent an IRS audit.  Return preparer fraud is one of the IRSs Dirty Dozen Tax Scams for 2013. In the past decade, the Justice Departments Tax Division has obtained injunctions against hundreds of unscrupulous tax preparers.
