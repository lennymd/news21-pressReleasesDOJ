  WASHINGTON  Todays shootings inElkins, West Virginia,demonstrate yet again the danger that our nations law enforcement officers confront on a daily basis. This morning, while attempting to serve a felony arrest warrant, three Deputy United States Marshals were met with gunfire from a dangerous fugitive who was eventually killed. In fulfilling their critical duties, these courageousDeputies put their lives on the line and put the safety of others above their own.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the family ofDeputy U.S. Marshal Derek Hotsinpiller, who made the ultimate sacrifice today,and with the two Deputieswhowere injured in the line of duty. Their valiant actions and their service to our nation will not be forgotten, and the Justice Departments ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of all those who serve in law enforcement will continue to be a top priority.
