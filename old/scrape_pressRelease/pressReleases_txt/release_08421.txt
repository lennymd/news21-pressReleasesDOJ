Burkett and Dallmeyer, both of the greater Houston area, pleaded guilty to racketeering aggravated assault for their role in the beating of an ABT prospect member.      According to court documents, the defendants were members of the ABT, a powerful race-based, state-wide organization that operated inside and outside of state and federal prisons throughout the United States.   The ABT was established in the early 1980s within the Texas prison system.   The gang modeled itself after and adopted many of the precepts and writings of the Aryan Brotherhood, a California-based prison gang that was formed in the California prison system during the 1960s.   According to court documents, previously, the ABT was primarily concerned with the protection of white inmates and white supremacy/separatism.   Over time, the ABT has expanded its criminal enterprise to include illegal activities for profit. None  According to court documents, Burkett and Dallmeyer, along with nine fellow ABT gang members, participated in the beating of an ABT prospect member at the home of another ABT gang leader, Steven Walter Cooke, 48, aka Stainless, in Tomball, on Sept. 22, 2008.   The ABT prospect, who sustained serious bodily injury, was beaten by ABT gang members because he violated ABT rules of conduct.      Eleven of the 12 co-defendants have pleaded guilty for their roles in the assault.   The 12th ABT gang member, David Harlow, 43, aka, Bam Bam, was found guilty by Senior Judge Werlein on March 21, 2012, at trial in the Southern District of Texas. None  The case is being prosecuted by David Karpel of the Criminal Divisions Organized Crime and Gang Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Hileman of the Southern District of Texas.
