The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland has permanently barred Lateisha Kone aka Vanessa Dickens of Baltimore, Maryland, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction order prohibits Kone from acting as a federal tax return preparer and from owning, operating, or profiting from a tax-return preparation business. Kone agreed to the entry of the injunction but did not admit the allegations in the civil complaint against her.According to the complaint, Kone owned and operated six Liberty Tax Service franchise stores in Baltimore. Kone and her employees allegedly prepared federal income tax returns that, among other things, contained bogus Schedules C (Profit or Loss from Business) and intentionally omitted Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) income and Social Security Income. These fraudulent returns improperly generated federal income tax refunds and tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, for Kones clients, according to the complaint.The government alleges that Kone and her employees filed 1,222 returns that reported fictitious household help income (HSH Income). Many of the returns allegedly reported substantially the same amount of HSH income, which generated fraudulent Earned Income Tax Credits and federal tax refunds. Kone then kept each refund as a preparation fee while the customers only received a $50 cash payment as part of the Liberty Tax Cash-In-A-Flash promotion, according to the complaint.None
