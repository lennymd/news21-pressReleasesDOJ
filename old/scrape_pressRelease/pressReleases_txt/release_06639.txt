NoneNone           Allegedly, from January 2002 to March 2011, Tremco knowingly violated its contractual obligations to provide GSA with current, accurate and complete information about its commercial sales practices, to report changes in discounts to comparable commercial customers and to pass those discounts on to government customers.   As a result, the government allegedly paid more than it should have for Tremcos services and products.  In addition, Tremco allegedly improperly marketed generic products as a superior line of the same product and used a defective adhesive formula in its roofing systems.           The GSA MAS program provides government purchasers with a streamlined process for procurement of commonly used commercial goods and services.   To be awarded a MAS contract, and thereby gain access to the broad government marketplace and ease of administration that comes from selling to hundreds of government purchasers under one contract, contractors must agree to disclose commercial pricing policies and practices.NoneNone None           This settlement was the result of a coordinated effort by the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Departments Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia and GSAs Office of Inspector General to investigate the allegations and resolve the case.
