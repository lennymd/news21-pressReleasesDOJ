From 2011 through 2014, Harris allegedly filed federal tax returns that claimed bogus business losses to which his clients were not entitled. The indictment charges that after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revoked Harriss Electronic Filing Identification Number (EFIN) in December 2012, he used another persons EFIN to file additional tax returns.

If convicted, Harris faces a statutory maximum sentence of three years in prison for each count. He also faces a term of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Mountcastle commended special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorneys Michael C. Boteler and William M. Montague of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case. None
