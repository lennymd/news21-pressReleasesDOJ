WASHINGTONAttorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Monday in response to President Obamas announcement of his intent to nominate Sally Yates, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, to serve as the next Deputy Attorney General, succeeding James M. Cole:"I congratulate Sally Yates on her forthcoming nomination as Deputy Attorney General -- an important and demanding office in which she will most certainly excel."Over the years, I have come to know, admire, and rely on Sally as an essential leader of the U.S. Attorney community. As a longtime career prosecutor, she has handled a wide range of complex and high-profile cases with remarkable skill and poise."Sally's leadership in combating public corruption has rightfully earned the accolades of her colleagues at every level of law enforcement. Her successful prosecution of Eric Rudolph for the Centennial Olympic Park bombing cemented her sterling reputation as a tough, and extremely talented, attorney. And her distinguished tenure as U.S. Attorney, and service as vice chair of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, have been marked by indelible contributions in advancing the Justice Department's Smart on Crime initiative and other important policies.As Deputy Attorney General, Sally will play a critical role in leading the Department of Justice, building on our Smart on Crime reforms, and expanding on the record of achievement we have established during the last six years. I know her tenure will be defined by the same standard of excellence that has guided her throughout her career, and I am proud to join President Obama in congratulating her, once again, on her planned nomination."
