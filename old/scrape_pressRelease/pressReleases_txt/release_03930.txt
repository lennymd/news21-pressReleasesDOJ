Defendant, Allegedly Inspired by ISIL, Attempted to Obtain Weapons and Explosives to Conduct AttacksHarlem Suarez, also known as Almlak Benitez, 23, of Key West, Florida, was charged by a criminal complaint with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against a person or property within the United States.NoneAccording to the complaint, Harlem Suarez, a self-professed ISIL adherent, knowingly attempted to use a weapon of mass destruction - a backpack bomb - in the United States, said Assistant Attorney General Carlin. Stopping attacks on our homeland by those inspired or directed by designated foreign terrorist organizations is the highest priority of the National Security Division.The top priority of the Department of Justice is to protect the security of the American people, said U.S. Attorney Ferrer. The U.S. Attorneys Office, in collaboration with the FBI, works tirelessly to advance this mission by continuing to thwart home-grown acts of terrorism.There is no room for failure when it comes to investigating the potential use of a weapon of mass destruction, said Special Agent in Charge Piro. The FBI and our local, state and federal partners work around the clock to prevent such catastrophic weapons from being used against our citizens. Even so, we ask the public to be vigilant and report suspicious activity to law enforcement.According to the complaint, in April 2015, Suarez came to the attention of the FBI due to Facebook posts that contained extremist rhetoric and promoted the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a designated foreign terrorist organization.The complaint further alleges that Suarez told the confidential source that he wanted to make a timer bomb. Suarez purchased components for this device, which was to contain galvanized nails, be concealed in a backpack and be remotely detonated by a cellphone. Suarez intended to bury the device at a public beach in Key West and then detonate it.On July 27, 2015, Suarez took possession of an inert device and was arrested.NoneA complaint is only an accusation and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
