President Obama Establishes Federal Interagency Reentry CouncilAn estimated 70 million or more Americans have some kind of criminal record. Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from Federal and State prisons, and millions more are released each year from local jails. Promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals who have paid their debt to society makes communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assists those who return from prison, jail, or juvenile justice facilities to become productive citizens; and saves taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.Providing incarcerated individuals with job and life skills, education programming, and mental health and addiction treatment increases the likelihood that they will be successful when released. Policies that limit opportunities for people with criminal records create barriers to employment, education, housing, health care, and civic participation. All of these are critical to reducing recidivism and strengthening communities.As part of National Reentry Week, the Administration has taken a series of steps to reform the federal approach to reentry by addressing barriers to reentry, supporting state and local efforts to do the same, and engaging the private sector to provide individuals who have earned a second chance the opportunity to participate in the American economy.Today, the President will sign a Presidential Memorandum establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council to lead the Governments work on the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails. The Attorney General has successfully led a Cabinet-level working group for the last five years, and this Memorandum will build on that success and ensure that the Federal Government will continue this important work.The Administration is taking important steps to reduce barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated individuals:Early inquiries into an applicant's criminal history may discourage motivated, well-qualified individuals who have served their time from applying for a federal job. Early inquiries could also lead to the disqualification of otherwise eligible candidates, regardless of whether an arrest actually resulted in charges or a conviction, and regardless of whether consideration of an applicant's criminal history is justified by business necessity. These barriers to employment unnecessarily narrow the pool of eligible and qualified candidates for federal employment, while also limiting opportunities for those with criminal histories to obtain the means to support themselves and their families.The rule would also allow agencies to request exceptions where there are legitimate job-related reasons why they might need to obtain a candidate's background information sooner in the hiring process. Unless an exception is granted, only after a conditional job offer is made will candidates be asked questions about criminal and credit history that may bear on their suitability for federal employment.Engaging the Private Sector and Honoring Champions of ChangeNoneIn the two weeks since these initial companies took the pledge, an additional 93 companies and organizations have joined the pledge, including Microsoft, Best Buy, Lyft, Kellogg Company, Staples, TrueBlue, the Oklahoma City Thunder, Catholic Charities USA, NAACP, Manufacturing Alliance of Philadelphia, American Civil Liberties Union, the American Sustainable Business Council and dozens of small and medium-sized companies from across the country.NoneNoneAdditional Federal Agency Actions To Reduce Barriers During National Reentry WeekAs part of National Reentry Week, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council agencies have announced additional steps to improve the rehabilitation and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals:None
