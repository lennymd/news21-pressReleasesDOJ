As part of his plea agreement, Briguet has agreed to pay the IRS restitution in the amount of $169,935.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo commended special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation who investigated the case, and Trial Attorneys Mark Kotila and Jeffrey Bender and Senior Litigation Counsel Mark Daly of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case.
