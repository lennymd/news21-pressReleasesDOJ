      WASHINGTON- Nelson Santos, aka Nelly and King Nelly, 27, of Silver Spring, Md., was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams Jr. to 190 months in prison for conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in connection with his gang activities as a member of the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (Latin Kings).  Santos was also ordered to serve five years of supervised release following his prison term.       The sentence was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Theresa R. Stoop of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) - Baltimore Field Division; Chief J. Thomas Manger of the Montgomery County Police Department; Montgomery County States Attorney John McCarthy; Chief Roberto L. Hylton of the Prince Georges County Police Department; and Prince Georges County States Attorney Glenn Ivey.       According to Santos plea agreement, the Latin Kings is a violent street gang with thousands of members across the country and overseas. The Latin Kings have a detailed and uniform organizational structure, which is outlined along with various prayers, codes of behavior and rituals  in a written manifesto widely distributed to members throughout the country. Members of the Latin Kings are also traditionally given King Names or Queen Names, which are names other than their legal names, by which they are known to members of the gang and to others on the street. At the local level, groups of Latin Kings are organized into tribes, including, but not limited to, the Royal Lion Tribe, MOG, Sun Tribe and UTL.        According to the plea agreement, Santos became a member of the Royal Lion Tribe in Maryland in 2007. Santos admitted that he participated in Latin King-sanctioned missions, including the armed robbery of a prostitute at a motel in Laurel, Md., on Dec. 14, 2007. According to the statement of facts, Santos and other Latin King members and associates drove in two separate vehicles to the motel, where they forced their way into a motel room, which they knew to be occupied by a prostitute. Santos and the other Latin King members and associates were armed with a gun and a knife. The prostitute was forced to strip naked on the bed, while the Latin Kings ransacked her room and stole cash, an X-Box, video games, a cell phone, a laptop and other items. The man who was in the room with the prostitute was held captive in the bathroom and pistol-whipped on the head.        Also according to the plea agreement, on April 28, 2009, in Wheaton, Md., Santos, a previously convicted felon who was prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition, knowingly possessed a Leinad 9mm Mac-11 machine pistol with an obliterated serial number, which was loaded with 27 rounds of 9mm ammunition.       Co-defendants Miguel Cruz, aka Skibee and King Skibee, 45, of the Bronx, N.Y., one of the founders of the Maryland tribe of the Latin Kings, and Andres Echevarria, aka B-Boy and King B-Boy, 23, of Brooklyn, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the racketeering conspiracy in connection with their gang activities and were sentenced to 87 months in prison and 19 years in prison, respectively.
