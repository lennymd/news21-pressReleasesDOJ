  The Department of Justice announced today that it will require Verizon and four of the nations largest cable companiesComcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Cox Communicationsto make changes to a series of agreements concerning both the sale of bundled wireless and wireline services, and the formation of a technology research joint venture. The department said that, if left unaltered, the agreements would have harmed competition by diminishing the companies incentive to compete, resulting in higher prices and lower quality for consumers. The announcement came after a closely coordinated investigation with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with additional assistance provided by the New York State Attorney Generals Office.
