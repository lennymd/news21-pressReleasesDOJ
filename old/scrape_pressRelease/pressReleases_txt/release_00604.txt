Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana J. Boente announced today that T&R Productions, LLC (T&R), a Washington, D.C., corporation, registered today with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) as an agent for ANO TV-Novosti, the Russian government entity responsible for the worldwide broadcasts of the RT Network (RT). The National Security Divisions FARA Registration Unit is reviewing T&Rs filings for sufficiency. Americans have a right to know who is acting in the United States to influence the U.S. government or public on behalf of foreign principals, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. The Department of Justice is committed to enforcing FARA and expects compliance with the law by all entities engaged in specified activities on behalf of any foreign principal, regardless of its nationality. FARA does not inhibit freedom of expression, does not restrict the content of information disseminated, does not restrict an agents lobbying or publication of information or advocacy and applies neutrally to all foreign countries. It requires public disclosure of certain activities and relationships through registration by agents of foreign principals with the Justice Department. FARA does not limit publishing of materials or viewpoints; it requires only registration, labeling of informational materials and broadcasts, and recordkeeping. Congress passed FARA in 1938, intending to ensure that the American public and our lawmakers know the source of information that is provided at the behest of a foreign principal, where that information may be intended to influence U.S. public opinion, policy and laws. The law does not restrict registrants from operating, however. Other U.S. agents of foreign media entities are currently registered under FARA and continue to operate freely in the United States. None
