An Orem, Utah former chiropractor, who also owned a health care products business, was sentenced to 33 months in prison for tax evasion and corruptly endeavoring to obstruct the internal revenue laws, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and U.S. Attorney John W. Huber for the District of Utah. Louis Hansen, 65, was convicted following a jury trial in July. According to documents submitted to the court and evidence presented at trial, Hansen attempted to evade the payment of his federal income taxes for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010. For the years 2005, 2006 and 2010, Hansen filed a tax return reporting that he owed taxes, but did not fully pay the amounts due. For 2007, Hansens return was audited and additional taxes assessed. In March 2012, Hansen sent a check to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $342,699 that was drawn on a closed bank account held in the name of another individual, and claimed that the check paid off his tax debt. Hansen then sent a signed letter to the revenue officer assigned to collect his unpaid taxes, claiming that he had paid the taxes owed. A few months later, Hansen sent 10 additional checks all in the amount of $425,000, to at least six IRS locations, all drawn on another closed account in the name of a different individual, claiming to pay the back taxes due.  In addition to the term of prison imposed, U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups sentenced Hansen to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution to the IRS in the amount of $342,699.  Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and U.S. Attorney Huber thanked special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin L. Sundwall and Assistant Chief Andrew Kameros of the Tax Division, who prosecuted the case. None
