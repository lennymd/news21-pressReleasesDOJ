The Department of Justice, the Department of the Army and the Department of the Interior today issued the following statement regarding the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers:We appreciate the D.C. Circuits opinion.We continue to respect the right to peaceful protest and expect people to obey the law.The Army continues to review issues raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Tribal nations and their members and hopes to conclude its ongoing review soon. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe. We repeat our request that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe.We also look forward to a serious discussion during a series of consultations, starting with a listening session in Phoenix on Tuesday, on whether there should be nationwide reform on the Tribal consultation process for these types of infrastructure projects.
