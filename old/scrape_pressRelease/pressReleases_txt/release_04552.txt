During this tax-filing season, the Justice Department announced today the results of its ongoing efforts to combat fraudulent tax return preparers and promoters of tax fraud schemes. The departments Tax Division has an active program to stop fraudulent return preparers and promoters from violating federal tax laws, particularly where the fraudulent activity can harm individual customers or drain the U.S. Treasury.According to available Internal Revenue Service (IRS) statistics, taxpayers filed approximately 145 million individual income tax returns in 2014, with more than 84 million individuals using a paid tax return preparer. The divisions civil enforcement efforts have been directed against both large-scale return preparation franchises and smaller, independent return preparers and promoters. Last year, the Tax Division obtained permanent injunctions against more than 40 preparers, promoters and businesses operating all over the United States.In 2014, the Tax Division continued its pursuit of tax return preparers and promoters who violate the tax laws through abusive schemes and scams, and take advantage of their customers, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Tax Division. The divisions attorneys and staff, along with our colleagues in the IRS, are committed to identifying, enjoining, and where appropriate, prosecuting those individuals who engage in such conduct.PreparersNoneYour refund should never be deposited directly into a preparers bank account.NoneDo not use a preparer who is willing to electronically file your return using your last pay stub instead of your W-2.
