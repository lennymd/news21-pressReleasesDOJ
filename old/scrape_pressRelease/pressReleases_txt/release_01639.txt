The Justice Department reached an agreement today with Levy Premium Foodservice Limited Partnership, doing business as Levy Restaurants, a national chain of sports arena restaurants.The settlement resolves the departments investigation of a charge filed by a work-authorized immigrant against Levys Barclay Center restaurant in Brooklyn, New York, alleging discrimination in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).The department concluded, based on its investigation that Levy discriminated against two lawful permanent residents at its Barclay Center restaurant by improperly reverifying their employment eligibility because of their immigration status.The department also determined that Levy improperly required them to present specific types of documents to re-establish their employment eligibility and suspended the charging party when he was unable to present such a document.The antidiscrimination provision of the INA prohibits employers from subjecting employees to unnecessary documentary demands based on the employees citizenship, immigration statusor national origin.Levy cooperated with the department throughout the investigation, quickly reinstated the charging party, and restored his lost wages and leave benefits.Under the settlement, Levy must pay a civil penalty to the United States, undergo department-provided training on the anti-discrimination provision of the INAand be subject to departmental monitoring and reporting requirements.The Justice Department is committed to ensuring the rights of lawful U.S. workers to be free from discriminatory barriers based on their citizenship, immigration statusor national origin, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division.We commend Levy for working with the Civil Rights Division to implement the corrective action resolving this matter.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration statusor national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral, should contact IERs worker hotline for assistance.None
