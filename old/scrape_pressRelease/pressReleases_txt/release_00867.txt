Officer Conspired to Cover Up Beating By Falsifying Records and Lying to Investigators None John Sanders, 30, of Marksville, Louisiana, admitted during his plea hearing that he punched the inmate repeatedly in the head in retaliation for an earlier incident; that he witnessed other officers use excessive force against the inmate and failed to intervene; that he conspired with other officers to cover up the beating by engaging in a variety of obstructive acts; and that he personally falsified official prison records in order to cover up the beating. Scotty Kennedy, 48, of Beebe, Arkansas, pled guilty in November 2016 for his role in the beating and cover up. Two co-defendants, Daniel Davis and James Savoy, remain scheduled for trial in January of 2018. A former correctional supervisor has admitted abusing a person in state custody and then lying to cover up his on-duty misconduct, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute correctional officers who use their official position to commit and to cover up violations of federal criminal law. Acting U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson stated, Our office remains committed to prosecuting violations of the federal criminal civil rights laws whenever sufficient evidence exists to do so. No one is above the law. This case is being investigated by the FBIs Baton Rouge Resident Office and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Divisions Criminal Section.
