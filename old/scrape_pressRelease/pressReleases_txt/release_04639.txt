Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Monday after Senator Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in Congress, announced that she would not be seeking re-election in 2016:For nearly four decades, Senator Mikulski has distinguished herself in the halls of Congress as a pioneering role model, a principled mentor and an inspiring force for positive change. She has demonstrated unparalleled leadership, unwavering dedication and vital skill. And she has exemplified the integrity, intelligence and constructive spirit that define public service at its best.From her days as a community organizer to her service as a city councilwoman to her distinction as the longest-serving woman in the history of the United States Congress, Senator Mikulski has been a fierce advocate for the people of Maryland, a trailblazer for women around the country and a champion on behalf of Americans who are too frequently overlooked and too often underserved. Her extraordinary contributions have left an indelible mark on her home state and on the nation she loves. Her commitment to progress has driven real and tangible change -from paycheck fairness to voting access and from domestic violence prevention to civil rights. And throughout my career at the Department of Justice, she has been a steadfast ally in the mission we share, a strong supporter of the departments work and employees and a vocal proponent of equal justice under the law.I offer my thanks for her service, for her friendship and for the remarkable legacy she will leave behind. I wish her well for the remainder of her term in the United States Senate. And I look forward to all that she will achieve in the next chapter of her extraordinary career.
