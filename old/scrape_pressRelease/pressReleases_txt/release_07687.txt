None       The departments Antitrust Division worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California, which conducted its own investigation and filed a similar lawsuit today.         The department filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, in San Jose.  The lawsuit seeks to prevent eBay from adhering to or enforcing the agreement and from entering into any similar agreements with any other companies.  Intuit is already subject to a settlement prohibiting it from entering into such agreements as part of an earlier case with the department.       The department alleges the agreement, which was enforced at the highest levels of each company, barred either firm from soliciting each others employees, and for over a year barred at least eBay from hiring any employees from Intuit at all.  In court papers, the department alleges that Meg Whitman, then eBays CEO, and Scott Cook, Intuits founder and executive committee chair, were intimately involved in forming, monitoring and enforcing the anticompetitive agreement.  Cook was serving as a member of eBays board of directors at the same time he was making complaints about eBays recruiting of Intuit employees.      eBays agreement with Intuit hurt employees by lowering the salaries and benefits they might have received and deprived them of better job opportunities at the other company, said Joseph Wayland, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division.  The Antitrust Division has consistently taken the position that these kinds of agreements are per se unlawful under the antitrust laws.             According to the complaint, beginning no later than 2006, and lasting at least until 2009, eBay and Intuit entered an illegal agreement that restricted their ability to actively recruit employees from the other company, and for some period of time even restricted at least eBay from hiring any employees at Intuit.   In 2007, the pact evolved into an agreement that eBay would not recruit Intuits employees.  eBays recruiting personnel were instructed to not pursue potential applications that came from Intuit and to throw away such resumes, the department said.           As stated in the departments complaint, eBay and Intuit are direct competitors for employees, including specialized computer engineers and scientists covered by the agreements at issue in the case.None     eBay is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Jose.
