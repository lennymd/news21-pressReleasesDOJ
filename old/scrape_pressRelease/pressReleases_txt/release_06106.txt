None   A one-count felony charge was filed today in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit against Kazuaki Fujitani, a former director of Denso Corp. in Japan. According to the charge, Fujitani, who was general manager of the Toyota Sales Division at the time of the offense, deleted numerous e-mails and electronic documents in February and March 2010 upon learning that the FBI had executed a search warrant on Densos U.S. subsidiary. The deleted documents contained communications between Denso and one or more of its competitors regarding requests for price quotation made by Toyota for heater control panels for the Toyota Avalon. The plea agreement is subject to court approval.   Todays charge demonstrates the Antitrust Divisions commitment to protecting the integrity of grand jury investigations, said Brent Snyder, Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Divisions criminal enforcement program. The division will vigorously prosecute individuals who destroy evidence in an attempt to conceal their participation in illegal conspiracies.   In March 2012, Denso pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a $78 million criminal fine for its role in conspiracies to fix the prices of heater control panels and electronic control units.NoneNoneNone
