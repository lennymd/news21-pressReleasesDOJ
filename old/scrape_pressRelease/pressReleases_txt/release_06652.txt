  The Justice Department announced that yesterday a federal court in Ft. Worth, Texas permanently barred Karena Mondrianh, of Southlake, Texas, from preparing tax returns and from operating a tax-preparation business. Mondrianh consented to entry of the preliminary injunctions without admitting the allegations against her.  In its complaint, the government alleged that Mondrianh prepared fraudulent tax returns understating customers income by inventing  sometimes without customers knowledge  false business expenses and by falsely claiming that customers income was exempt from tax. According to the complaint most of Mondrianhs customers work overseas for defense contractors. The permanent injunction order was signed by Judge John H. McBryde of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.NoneNone
