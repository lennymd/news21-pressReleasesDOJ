  WASHINGTON  The Attorney General made the following statement today:  In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bob Mueller led the transformation of the FBI into what today is the worlds pre-eminent counterterrorism agency. One of the most respected prosecutors of his generation before joining the FBI as its Director, he has earned the confidence of two Presidents for his ability to lead and hiscalmness under fire.   A short-term legislative change will allow Bob to remain at the FBI for an additional two years so the Presidents counterterrorism team can continue to work together seamlessly. The United States faces ongoing threats from terrorists intent on attacking us both at home and abroad, and it is crucial that the FBI have sustained, strong leadership to confront that threat. There is no better person for that job than Bob Mueller. I hope he will be allowed to continue providing the able leadership and unquestioned integrity for which he is known for the remainder of the Presidents term.
