Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement today on the passing of civil rights leader Amelia Boynton Robinson:With the passing of Amelia Boynton Robinson, America has lost a spirited advocate, a passionate activist and a trailblazing champion in the fight for civil rights and social justice. Driven by her faith and her moral convictions, Ms. Boynton Robinson stood on the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement in Selma and beyond, inspiring countless men, women and children to stand up to injustice, to speak out for equality and to demand their opportunity to shape the future of this nation. Her legacy continues to be felt today  at the Department of Justice and across the country  in the expanded voting rights she helped to win; in the ongoing work of equality she helped to advance; and in the desire for a more just society that will always drive us forward. While Ms. Boynton Robinsons journey on this earth has come to an end, the principles to which she dedicated her life  and the spirit of determination she brought to her mission  will forever march on. My thoughts and prayers are with her family, her friends and all who loved her.
