  WASHINGTON The Department of Justice today announced that it is accepting applications from American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities for funding to improve public safety in Indian country. The funds are available through the Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS), a streamlined single solicitation for existing tribal government-specific grant programs administered by the Office of Justice Programs, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and the Office on Violence Against Women.  The CTAS process is the result of consultations held with tribal leaders on how to improve the application process for tribal grant applicants. For FY 2011, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities will submit a single application for all available tribal government-specific grant programs. The coordinated approach allows the Justice Departments grant-making components to consider the totality of a tribal communitys overall public safety needs.  The FY 2011 solicitation includes revisions that will improve the award and application process, including a 90-day application period, closing April 21, 2011. Awards will be based upon available funding for FY 2011 and can be used to enhance law enforcement, bolster justice systems, prevent youth substance abuse, serve sexual assault and elder abuse victims, and support other efforts to combat crimes. Last year, CTAS provided more than $127 million to American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities nationwide.None  Todays announcement is part of the Justice Departments ongoing initiative to increase engagement, coordination and action on public safety in tribal communities.None
