  WASHINGTON  A former executive from Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation (Chi Mei) has agreed to plead guilty and to serve jail in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix the price of thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels, the Department of Justice announced today.   According to a one-count felony charge filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Wen-Hung Amigo Huang conspired with others to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels.   Huang, a resident of Taiwan and the former director of sales of Chi Mei, participated in the conspiracy from on or about Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec.1, 2006.   Under his plea agreement which is subject to court approval, Huang, who was charged today, has agreed to serve 9 months in jail, to pay a $25,000 criminal fine and to assist the department in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.  TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones and other electronic devices.   By the end of the conspiracy period, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was valued at $70 billion.   Companies directly affected by the LCD price-fixing conspiracy are some of the largest computer and television manufacturers in the world, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett Packard.   The department charged that Huang participated in a conspiracy in which the participants met and agreed to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at predetermined levels.   The participants in that conspiracy also issued price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached and exchanged information on the sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the agreed-upon prices, the department said.

The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.
