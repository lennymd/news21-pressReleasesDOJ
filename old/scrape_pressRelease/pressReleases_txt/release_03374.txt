Recoveries Exceed $3.5 Billion for Fourth Consecutive YearThe Department of Justice obtained more than $3.5 billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Departments Civil Division, announced today. This is the fourth year in a row that the department has exceeded $3.5 billion in cases under the False Claims Act, and brings total recoveries from January 2009 to the end of the fiscal year to $26.4 billion.The False Claims Act has again proven to be the governments most effective civil tool to ferret out fraud and return billions to taxpayer-funded programs, said Mizer. The recoveries announced today help preserve the integrity of vital government programs that provide health care to the elderly and low income families, ensure our national security and defense, and enable countless Americans to purchase homes.Of the $3.5billion recovered last year, $1.9 billion came from companies and individuals in the health care industry for allegedly providing unnecessary or inadequate care, paying kickbacks to health care providers to induce the use of certain goods and services, or overcharging for goods and services paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. The $1.9 billion reflects federal losses only. In many of these cases, the department was instrumental in recovering additional millions of dollars for consumers and state Medicaid programs.The next largest recoveries were made in connection with government contracts. The government depends on contractors to feed, clothe, and equip our troops for combat; for the military aircraft, ships, and weapons systems that keep our nation secure; as well as to provide everything that is needed to fund myriad programs at home. Settlements and judgments in cases alleging false claims for payment under government contracts totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2015.The False Claims Act is the governments primary civil remedy to redress false claims for government funds and property under government contracts, including national security and defense contracts, as well as under government programs as varied as Medicare, veterans benefits, federally insured loans and mortgages, highway funds, research grants, agricultural supports, school lunches, and disaster assistance. In 1986, Congress strengthened the Act by amending it to increase incentives for whistleblowers to file lawsuits on behalf of the government.NoneHealth Care Fraud NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneHousing and Mortgage FraudNoneNoneNoneGovernment ContractsNoneNoneNoneNoneOther Fraud Recoveries and ActionsNoneNoneNoneNoneThese suits and settlements illustrate the diversity of cases pursued by the department and the departments quest to root out fraud and false claims against the government wherever it may be found.Holding Individuals Accountable On Sept. 9, Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates issued a memorandum on individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing. This memorandum reinforced the departments commitment to use the False Claims Act and other civil enforcement tools to deter and redress fraud by individuals as well as corporations.NoneNoneRecoveries in Whistleblower SuitsNoneNoneMany of the recoveries obtained under the False Claims Act result from courageous men and women who come forward to blow the whistle on fraud they are often uniquely positioned to expose, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mizer.In 1986, Senator Charles Grassley and Representative Howard Berman led successful efforts in Congress to amend the False Claims Act to, among other things, encourage whistleblowers to come forward with allegations of fraud. In 2009, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, along with Senator Grassley and Representative Berman, championed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, which made additional improvements to the False Claims Act and other fraud statutes. And in 2010, the passage of the Affordable Care Act provided additional inducements and protections for whistleblowers and strengthened the provisions of the federal health care Anti-Kickback Statute.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mizer also expressed his deep appreciation for the many dedicated public servants who investigated and pursued these cases  the attorneys, investigators, auditors and other agency personnel throughout the Department of Justices Civil Division and the U.S. Attorneys Offices, as well as the agency Offices of Inspector General and the many federal and state agencies that contributed to the departments recoveries this past fiscal year.The departments lawyers and staff, together with our law enforcement partners in federal and state governments, work tirelessly and often overcome daunting challenges to achieve these successes on behalf of the taxpayers, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mizer.The governments claims in the matters described above are allegations only; except where indicated, there has been no determination of liability.
