  Attorney General Eric Holder and United States Attorney for the  Southern District of New York Preet Bharara announced today the completion of  the Justice Departments multi-year civil investigation pursuant to the Civil  Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) into the conditions of  confinement of adolescent male inmates on Rikers Island.   The investigation, which focused on use of  force by staff, inmate-on-inmate violence, and use of punitive segregation  during the period 2011-2013, concluded that there is a pattern and practice of  conduct at Rikers Island that violates the rights of adolescents protected by  the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of  the United States Constitution.   The  investigation found that adolescent inmates are not adequately protected from  physical harm due to the rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by New  York City Department of Correction (DOC) staff and violence inflicted by other  inmates.   In addition, the investigation  found that DOC relies too heavily on punitive segregation as a disciplinary  measure, placing adolescent inmates in what amounts to solitary confinement at  an alarming rate and for excessive periods of time.   Many of the adolescent inmates are  particularly vulnerable because they suffer from mental illness.   Attorney General Eric Holder said: The extremely high rates of  violence and excessive use of solitary confinement for adolescent males  uncovered by this investigation are inappropriate and unacceptable.   The Department of Justice is dedicated to  ensuring the effectiveness, safety and integrity of our criminal justice  systems.   Going forward, we will work  with the City of New York to make good on our commitment to reform practices  that are unfair and unjust, and to ensure that  in all circumstances, and  particularly when it comes to our young people  incarceration is used to deter,  punish, and ultimately rehabilitate, not merely to warehouse and forget.   U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said:  As our investigation has shown, for adolescents, Rikers Island is a broken  institution.   It is a place where brute  force is the first impulse rather than the last resort; where verbal insults are  repaid with physical injuries; where beatings are routine while accountability  is rare; and where a culture of violence endures even while a code of silence  prevails.   The adolescents in Rikers are  walled off from the public, but they are not walled off from the Constitution.    Indeed most of these young men are  pre-trial detainees who are innocent until proven guilty, but whether they are  pre-trial or convicted, they are entitled to be detained safely and in  accordance with their constitutional rights  not consigned to a corrections  crucible that seems more inspired by Lord of the Flies than any legitimate  philosophy of humane detention.   These  young men, automatically charged as adults despite their age under New York law,  may be on an island and out of sight, but they can no longer remain out of mind.    Attention must be paid immediately to  their rights, their safety and their mental well-being, and in the wake of this  report we will make sure that happens one way or another.   In its report to the City of New York, made public today, the  U.S. Attorneys Office notes that a deep-seated culture of violence is  pervasive throughout the adolescent facilities at Rikers, and DOC staff  routinely utilize force not as a last resort, but instead as a means to control  the adolescent population and punish disorderly or disrespectful behavior.   The following statistics are illustrative: None None None None None None None   The report makes the following specific factual determinations: None None None None None None None   The report further identifies the  following systemic deficiencies that are largely responsible for the excessive  and unnecessary use of force by DOC staff.    Many of these systemic deficiencies also lead to the high levels of  inmate-on-inmate violence.   These  deficiencies include: None None None None None None None None   Finally, DOCs use of prolonged  punitive segregation for adolescent inmates is excessive and inappropriate.    Adolescent inmates, many of whom have  mental illnesses, are routinely placed in what amounts to solitary confinement  for weeks and sometimes months at a time.    On any given day in 2013, 15-25 percent of the adolescent population were  in punitive segregation, often for infractions involving non-violent conduct.    According to census data for December  16, 2013, well over half the adolescents in punitive segregation on that day  were serving sentences for rule infractions of 60 days or more.   The report also sets forth the following 10 categories of  remedial measures necessary to address the constitutional violations  identified:   1.        House adolescent inmates separately in a DOC jail not physically  located on Rikers Island;   2.        Increase the number of cameras in adolescent areas;   3.        Revise use of force policy to clarify prohibited conduct;   4.        Ensure that staff submit complete, accurate, and prompt use of  force reports, and institute a zero-tolerance policy for failing to report;   5.        Ensure that use of force incidents are investigated thoroughly and  promptly, and hold staff accountable for biased or incomplete reports and  investigations;   6.        Ensure that inmates are adequately supervised, intervene to  de-escalate fights, and transfer vulnerable or otherwise at risk inmates to  alternative housing units;   7.        Improve officer training programs on use of force, conflict  resolution, reporting use of force, and handling of the adolescent  population;   8.        Ensure that staff are held accountable and disciplined for the use  of excessive and unnecessary force;   9.        Develop alternative disciplinary strategies that do not involve  lengthy isolation, and prohibit the placement of adolescents with mental health  disorders in solitary confinement;   10.    Develop and implement a strategic plan to create an institutional  culture that does not tolerate violence and holds staff accountable for  excessive or unnecessary use of force.   The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York  looks forward to engaging in discussions with the City to make system-wide  changes that will safeguard the constitutional rights of adolescents, and  prevent them from continuing to suffer unnecessary harm while in City custody.   U.S. Attorney Bharara thanks the Board of Correction for the  assistance it provided in connection with the Offices investigation.
