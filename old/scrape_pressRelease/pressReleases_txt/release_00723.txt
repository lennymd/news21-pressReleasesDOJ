None Based on its investigation, the department concluded that InMotion retaliated against a work-authorized job applicant after she protested InMotions requirement that she provide a Permanent Resident Card even though she had a valid employment authorization card issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. After the worker complained that InMotions request constituted discrimination under the INA, InMotion removed her from its pool of candidates available for job placement. The INAs anti-discrimination provision prohibits employers from retaliating against or intimidating workers because they have opposed employer conduct that may violate that provision or have participated in the departments activities to enforce it.  Under the settlement agreement, InMotion will pay the maximum civil penalty for an instance of retaliation, post notices informing workers about their rights under the INAs anti-discrimination provision, train its staff, and be subject to departmental monitoring and reporting requirements for one year. Employees must be able to assert their rights without fear of reprisal, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John M. Gore of the Civil Rights Division. Employers should familiarize themselves with the law and ensure that they do not engage in retaliatory conduct against workers who raise concerns about compliance. NoneNoneNoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to retaliation, different documentary requirements based on their citizenship/immigration status or national origin, or discrimination based on their citizenship/immigration status, or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral for a fee, should contact IERs worker hotline for assistance.
