None It is critical that all individuals, including those with disabilities, have access to health care. But far too often, barriers prevent people with disabilities from visiting a doctors office or a clinic, said Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez. Due to barriers, people with disabilities are less likely to receive even basic medical treatment that will prevent routine small problems from turning into major and possibly life threatening ones. This guidance promotes the core values of the health care reform legislation championed by this Administration, said Georgina C. Verdugo, director of HHS Office for Civil Rights. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private hospitals, doctors offices, clinics and other health care providers. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended prohibits disability based discrimination by all health care providers that receive federal financial assistance.None
