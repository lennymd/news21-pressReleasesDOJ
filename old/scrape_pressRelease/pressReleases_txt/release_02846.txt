The Justice Department filed a lawsuit and consent decree today to resolve allegations that Pain Management Care P.C., of South Bend, Indiana, refused to treat an individual because he has HIV, in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).The departments investigation found that the individual had sought interventional pain management treatment through anesthesiologist and pain management specialist Dr. Joseph Glazier. An employee of Pain Management Care informed the individual that Glazier would not treat him due to [his] condition of being HIV positive. Title III of the ADA prohibits public accommodations, such as healthcare providers, from discriminating against people with disabilities, including HIV.Under the consent decree, which still must be approved by the court, Pain Management Care P.C. will develop a non-discrimination policy, provide ADA training to its employees, submit annual reports to the United States, pay $20,000 to the complainant in monetary damages and $10,000 in civil penalties to the United States.The Justice Department is committed to eradicating discrimination resulting from the unfounded fear and dangerous stereotype that someone with HIV would pose a threat to a medical provider, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Discrimination by those in the medical profession breaks a trust critical to ensuring access to appropriate treatment for all.NoneNoneNone
