  WASHINGTON  A federal court today issued a preliminary injunction barring Karen Liane Miller of Nashville, Tenn., from preparing federal income tax returns for others. The court order found that Miller promotes a tax defier scheme that claims large fraudulent tax refunds for customers. The order, entered by U.S. District Judge Aleta A. Trauger, remains in effect while the lawsuit is pending. Violation of an injunction can result in civil and criminal sanctions, including fines and imprisonment.  The court found that Miller repeatedly prepared federal income tax returns claiming bogus refunds in "astonishing" amounts, based on a tax fraud scheme known as the "redemption" scheme. The court held that Miller prepared and filed 41 income tax returns for customers in 2009 claiming more than $8.3 million in fraudulent refunds. The court said that the redemption scheme is based on a frivolous theory that the federal government maintains secret accounts for its citizens, and that taxpayers can gain access to funds in those accounts by issuing IRS 1099-OID forms to their creditors.None   John A.
