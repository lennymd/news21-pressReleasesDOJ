  The Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that Dominion Energy has agreed to pay a $3.4 million civil penalty and spend approximately $9.8 million on environmental mitigation projects to resolve Clean Air Act (CAA) violations. The settlement will result in reductions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter by more than 70,000 tons per year, across three of the utilitys coal-fired power plants, located in Kincaid, Ill., State Line, Ind., and Somerset, Mass.None  Todays settlement substantially reduces harmful pollution from coal-fired power plants in and around communities with significant air pollution concerns, said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for the EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Along with the pollution reductions at the three power plants covered by the agreement, the settlement also requires Dominion to invest over $9 million in pollution reducing projects in neighboring communities.  Under the settlement, Dominion must install or upgrade pollution control technology on two plants, and permanently retire a third plant. Dominion will be required to operate the new and existing pollution controls continuously, and will be required to comply with stringent emission rates and annual tonnage limitations. The actions taken by Dominion to comply with this settlement will result in annual reductions at the Brayon Point and Kincaid plants of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 52,000 tons from 2010 levels. The retirement of the State Line plant will result in an additional reduction of 18,000 tons of SO2 and NOx.NoneNoneNone  The settlement was lodged today in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, and is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.
