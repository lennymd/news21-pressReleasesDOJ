With the arrival of these 11individuals,Mexico has now extradited 100 defendantstotheUnited States in2009, the highestyearlynumber of extraditions fromMexicoto date. The extradition of 95 defendants in 2008 was the previous record number of extraditions for one year from Mexico.  "The extradition of these 11 defendants exemplifies the strong cooperative relationship between the United States and Mexico," said Attorney General Eric Holder. "Each year since 2001, Mexico has increased the number of defendants it extradites to the United States. By ensuring that alleged criminals are held accountable, we send a strong message that fleeing across the border does not mean you will escape justice. I am looking forward to meeting Attorney General Chavez tomorrow and discussing additional ways we as law enforcement partners can work together to hold such defendants, particularly alleged leaders and associates of drug cartels, accountable."  The defendants arrived in the United States on Saturday, Oct. 31, 2009, and will be transferred to the jurisdictions in which they face charges.
