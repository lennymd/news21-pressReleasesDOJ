Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Environment and Natural Resources Division made the following statement regarding President Obamas Presidential Memorandum on Climate Change and National Security. The memorandum announced today establishes a policy that the impacts of climate change must be considered in the development of national security-related doctrine, policies, and plans:Climate change presents real and in some cases imminent consequences for our nations environment and natural resources, but it will also gravely impact the entire world, our weather systems, the frequency of natural disasters and infectious disease, the viability of our coastal cities and the sustainability of our food, water resources and wildlife. It is nothing short of a threat to national security, world order and the rule of law. We must meet this threat to the planet we all share with courageous and far-sighted action.
