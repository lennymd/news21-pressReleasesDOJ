The Justice Department announced today that the developers and designers of 31 apartment buildings in or near Helena, Montana, have agreed to settle a lawsuit alleging that the buildings were not built to be accessible to people with disabilities, as required by the Fair Housing Act.The departments lawsuit, which was also filed today, alleges that the developers and designers of the properties designed and built the 64 ground floor apartments at these buildings with steps to unit entrances, inaccessible bathrooms and kitchens or other features that make them inaccessible to people with disabilities. The defendants named in the suit include the developers and their affiliated companies  Gabriel Nistler, Sommer Nistler, Ross Royland, Patrick Royland, Royland & Nistler Properties LLC and Werner-Nistler Properties LLC  and the designers of the properties, Derek Brown and Derek Brown Consulting Inc.Under the settlement, which still must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, the defendants must undertake extensive corrective actions to make the apartment buildings accessible to persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users. These corrective actions include:All people with disabilities deserve an equal opportunity to live in the housing of their choice, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. By removing accessibility barriers in existing buildings and creating new accessible units, this settlement will help ensure that individuals with disabilities in Helena, Montana, enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Fair Housing Act.This settlement is emblematic of the Justice Departments commitment to fair housing standards for all, said U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter of the District of Montana. It sends a message that failing to consider the needs of individuals with disabilities in the construction of new housing is simply not acceptable in Montana communities, and helps ensure that the needs of those individuals will be considered from the earliest stages of the design and permitting processes.NoneNoneNoneNone
