The Justice Department reached an agreement today with Brickell Financial Services Motor Club, Inc., d/b/a Road America Motor Club, Inc. (Road America), headquartered in Miami, Florida. The settlement resolves the departments investigation into whether the company violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by discriminating against work-authorized immigrants when verifying their work authorization.NoneWhen verifying the work authorization of employees, employers may not erect unnecessary barriers based on employees citizenship or national origin, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division. Employers must ensure they are aware of their legal obligations to avoid discrimination, and we applaud Road America for committing itself to do so through this settlement.Under the settlement, Road America will pay a civil penalty of $34,200 and pay $1,044 to compensate a worker who lost wages due to its unfair documentary practices. Road America has also agreed to post notices informing workers about their rights under the INAs antidiscrimination provision, train their human resources personnel, and be subject to departmental monitoring and reporting requirements. NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral, should contact IERs worker hotline for assistance.None
