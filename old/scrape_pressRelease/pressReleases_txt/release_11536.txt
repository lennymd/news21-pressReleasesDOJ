None"This year cannot just be an anniversary  it must be a call to action."I am honored to help the Department of Justice bring awareness to the 15th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and, specifically stalking awareness," said Paula Zahn. "I have covered the issue of violence against women extensively over my more than 30 years in journalism and I know that its critically important that we commemorate how far weve come and explore how we can work together to do even more. I am proud to be a voice for this initiative."NoneExpert panelists included Michelle Garcia, Director of the National Stalking Resource Center; Cindy Southworth, Director of Safety Net: The National Safe and Strategic Technology Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence ; Linda Major, Executive Director of Domestic Violence Affairs for the Marion County, Indiana prosecutors office; and Mark Wynn, former Nashville police officer and national trainer on stalking protocol and procedures.Each year, approximately 3.4 million Americans are victims of stalking, a crime that is pervasive, dangerous and  far too often  lethal. Nearly three in four stalking victims know their offender in some capacity, and 30 percent of victims are stalked by a current or former intimate partner. While both men and women can be victims of stalking, women are nearly three times more likely to be stalked.In the past decade, the use of technology by stalkers has become commonplace. According to National Stalking Resource Center, among the most common stalking behaviors that victims experience are unwanted phone calls and messages (66 percent) and unwanted e-mails and letters (31 percent). More than one in four victims report that stalkers have used technology, such as e-mail or instant messaging, to follow and harass them, and one in 13 says stalkers use electronic devices to intrude on their lives.Todays event is another installment in the Justice Departments mission to raise public awareness on issues around violence against women, to build and renew coalitions among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement and victim services communities, and to end stalking, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence for men, women and children across the country. As part of this public awareness initiative, the Department has encouraged the more than 100 celebrity allies, including Paula Zahn, who have lent their names in support of the Departments "Join the List" initiative to raise awareness with their fans, through Web and fan sites, and social networking profiles.None
