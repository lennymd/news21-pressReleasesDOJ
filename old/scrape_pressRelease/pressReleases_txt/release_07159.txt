None       The summary, which follows issuance of the agencies October 2011 antitrust enforcement policy statement regarding ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), reports that during the time period covered, the ACO Working Group fielded 33 questions related principally to primary service area (PSA) share calculations, and two requests for voluntary expedited review from proposed ACOs.       Under the policy statement, an ACO may calculate its PSA shares to determine whether it falls within an antitrust safety zone for certain ACOs that are highly likely to raise significant competitive concerns.  The ACO Working Group responded to most of the 33 PSA share questions within five business days, and in connection with the release of the summary is now making the questions and answers publicly available on their websites. The largest category of questions concerned obtaining and using Medicare and other data to calculate PSA shares.       Also under the policy statement, a newly formed ACO may request voluntary expedited antitrust review of its program.  Both of the ACOs that sought such review during the time period covered by the summary withdrew their requests.
