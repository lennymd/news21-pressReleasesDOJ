A federal court in Memphis, Tenn., permanently barred the owners of Mo Money Taxes, Markey Granberry and Derrick Robinson, as well as a former Mo Money manager, Eumora Reese, from preparing tax returns for others and owning or operating a tax return preparation business, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order, to which Granberry, Robinson and Reese agreed without admitting the allegations against them, was signed by Judge S. Thomas Anderson of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.NoneAccording to the complaint, Granberry and Robinson most recently used the business name Marquis Taxes and, along with Reese, also used the name Southern King Taxes. The complaint also alleges that Granberry and Robinson received fees for each tax return prepared by these businesses through Caymau Service Bureau LLC. The civil injunction order not only bars Granberry, Robinson and Reese from owning and operating these businesses, but also from managing, working in, controlling, licensing or franchising a tax return preparation business.The complaint alleges that Granberry, Robinson and Reese encouraged Mo Money Taxes preparers to falsely claim the earned-income credit; claim improper filing status; claim bogus education credits, improperly prepare returns using paystubs rather than employer-issued W-2 forms; fabricate bogus W-2 forms; file tax returns without customers consent; sell false and deceptive loan products; and charge deceptive and unconscionable fees.NoneAmerican taxpayers need to know they can rely on their tax preparers to prepare honest, accurate returns, said Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division. The Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department are committed to strong enforcement action against tax preparers who fail to live up to that standard.NoneRelated Materials:None
