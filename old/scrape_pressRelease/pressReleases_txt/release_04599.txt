Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Wednesday regarding the fatal shooting of Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells:Deputy Marshal Josie Wells was a dedicated law enforcement officer, a remarkable patriot and a courageous public servant. Though he was taken from us far too suddenly and far too soon, he leaves behind an indelible legacy that will live on in the lives he touched; in the work that the U.S. Marshals Service continues to perform; and in a world that is safer because of his devoted service. His loss is a deeply tragic reminder that the work of our law enforcement officers around the nation is extremely serious, profoundly heroic and deserving of our most emphatic support. The thoughts and prayers of the law enforcement community will be with the family and loved ones of Deputy Marshal Wells throughout this difficult time. And as we go forward, the Department of Justice intends to honor his service and his sacrifice by continuing to fight for the values he protected every day, and to defend the American people for whom he gave his life.
