  A federal court in Fresno,  California, has permanently barred Ken Mendoza and Alice Mendoza from preparing  federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  Ken  Mendoza and Alice Mendoza, who operated under the business name Mendoza  Business Services in Fresno, consented to the civil injunction order, which was  signed by U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. ONeill in the U.S. District Court for  the Eastern District of California.   According to the complaint, the  Mendozas improperly understate their customers federal tax liabilities by  fabricating expenses, claiming false or inflated credits, particularly  educational credits, and deducting personal expenses of their customers.  In  total, the complaint alleges that the loss to the U.S. Treasury from the  Mendozas activities could be as much as $2.8 million for tax years 2010 through  2011.  The complaint also alleges that many of the Mendozas customers may owe  additional tax, interest and penalties because of the improperly prepared  returns.   In addition to barring the  Mendozas from preparing or filing federal tax returns for others, the court also  enjoined anyone acting in concert with the Mendozas from preparing or filing  federal tax returns, and prohibited the Mendozas from requesting or directing  the preparation of federal tax returns for others.  The court required the  Mendozas to contact all persons for whom they prepared a federal tax return  since Jan. 1, 2008, to inform all such persons of the permanent injunction  entered against them.None
