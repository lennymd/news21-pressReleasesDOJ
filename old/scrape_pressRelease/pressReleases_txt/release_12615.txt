  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice announced today the settlement of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Anthony D. Jackson, an Air Force National Guard member, against Union County College (UCC) under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).  Jackson and UCC jointly submitted a consent decree to the court that, if approved, will resolve all claims asserted by Jackson in the case. The consent decree requires UCC to pay Jackson for lost wages and other damages.  The complaint, filed on Dec.14, 2007, alleged that UCC suspended Jackson from his job as a security officer, discharged him from that job while he was on active military duty and failed promptly to re-employ him upon his return from active military duty, because of his membership in, or obligation to perform service in, the uniformed services.  "Service members should not be made to fear for their livelihood because they answered our countrys call," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the rights of the brave women and men who sacrifice to serve and protect America."None
