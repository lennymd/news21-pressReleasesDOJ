The Justice Departments Antitrust Division, at the request of the Federal Trade Commission, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. against Caledonia Investments plc for violating the premerger notification and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976 when it acquired voting securities of Bristow Group Inc. in February 2014. At the same time, the department filed a proposed settlement, subject to approval by the court, under which Caledonia Investments has agreed to pay a $480,000 civil penalty to resolve the lawsuit.The HSR Act imposes notification and waiting period requirements for transactions meeting certain size thresholds so that they can undergo premerger antitrust review. Federal courts can assess civil penalties for premerger notification violations under the HSR Act in lawsuits brought by the department. The maximum civil penalty for an HSR violation increased from $16,000 per day to $40,000 per day effective Aug. 1.NoneNoneCaledonia CISCaledonia ComplaintCaledonia ExplanationCaledonia PFJCaledonia Stipulation
