None NoneNoneNone  The government complaint, filed simultaneously with the settlement agreement in the U.S. District Court in Charlotte, N.C., alleges a pattern of violations that was discovered through site inspections and by reviewing documentation submitted by Ryland. The alleged violations include failure to obtain permits until after construction began, failing to obtain permits at all, or failing to comply with permit requirements at sites where Ryland did obtain permits. Alleged permit violations include not developing complete stormwater pollution prevention plans, failure to conduct adequate inspections, and failure to install or implement adequate stormwater controls or practices. None  The settlement requires Ryland to obtain all required permits; develop site-specific pollution prevention plans for each construction site; conduct additional site inspections beyond those required by stormwater regulations; and document and promptly correct any problems detected. The company must properly train construction managers and contractors on stormwater requirements and designate trained staff for each site.   Ryland must also submit national compliance summary reports to EPA based on its quarterly management oversight inspections and reviews. None  Seven states have joined the settlement. The states of Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada and the commonwealth of Virginia will receive a portion of the $625,000 penalty.   The settlement also includes sites in the states of California, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. None None
