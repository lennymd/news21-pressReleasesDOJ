The Department of Justice today announced that it has entered into a settlement with Z Street, a non-profit corporation dedicated to educating the public about various issues related to Israel and the Middle East, pending approval by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Z Street alleged that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applied heightened scrutiny to applications for tax-exempt status received from organizations connected in any way to Israel, and applied this policy to Z Streets application, resulting in delay. The settlement agreement includes an apology from the IRS to Z Street for the delayed processing of the groups application for tax-exempt status. Tax exemption eligibility should be based on whether an organizations activities fulfill requirements of the law, not a groups policy positions or the name chosen to reflect those views, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman. The attorneys at the Department of Justice work hard to ensure that all Americans receive equal treatment under the law. Todays settlement further illustrates this commitment. None None
