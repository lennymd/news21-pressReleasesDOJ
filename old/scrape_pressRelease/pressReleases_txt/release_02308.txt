The Lawsuit is the First Challenge to a State-Run School System for Segregating Students with DisabilitiesThe Justice Department announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against the state of Georgia alleging that its treatment and segregation of students with disabilities in the Georgia Network for Educational and Therapeutic Support (GNETS) Program violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).         NoneNoneSeventeen years ago, the Supreme Court made clear that states must serve people with disabilities, including children with disabilities, in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Georgia has relegated thousands of students with behavior-related disabilities to separate, segregated and unequal settings, and placed other students at serious risk of entering such settings, failing to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Justice Department seeks to make the promise of community integration a reality for all of the states students. Students with disabilities in Georgia are entitled to access the services and supports that they need in the most integrated setting appropriate, where they can interact with and learn alongside their non-disabled peers and access educational opportunities that are equal to those available to other students.This complaint alleges that many children in the GNETS Program are consigned to dilapidated buildings that were formerly used for black children during segregation, or to classrooms that are locked apart from mainstream classrooms, with substantially fewer opportunities of participating in extracurricular activities like music, art and sports, said U.S. Attorney John A. Horn of the Northern District of Georgia. The law mandates that all children, including those with behavior-related disabilities, must have equal opportunities for education, and several existing programs within our Georgia schools show that with appropriate support and services, these students can enjoy far greater integration with their peers.The lawsuit further alleges that as a result of the states unnecessary segregation, students in GNETS lack equal access to academic and extracurricular opportunities enjoyed by their peers outside the GNETS Program. Mental health and therapeutic educational services and supports are available in Georgia to a limited number of students with disabilities in integrated educational settings. The students who receive such services, many of whom have disabilities similar to GNETS students, are able to interact to the fullest extent possible with their non-disabled peers, participate in curriculum that corresponds to appropriate grade-level standards and partake in a wide range of extracurricular activities.NoneGNETS Complaint
