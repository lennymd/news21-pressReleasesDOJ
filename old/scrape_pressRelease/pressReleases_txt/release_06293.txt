NoneNoneNoneNone Discrimination is a serious issue across every consumer credit market, said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. We are returning $80 million to hard-working consumers who paid more for their cars or trucks based on their race or national origin. We look forward to working closely with the Justice Department and Ally to make sure this serious issue will be addressed appropriately in the years ahead as well. Rather than taking applications directly from consumers, Ally makes most of its loans through over 12,000 car dealers nationwide who help their customers pay for their new or used car by submitting their loan application to Ally. Allys business practice, like most other major auto lenders, allows car dealers discretion to vary a loans interest rate from the price Ally initially sets based on the borrowers objective credit-related factors. Dealers receive greater payments from Ally on loans that include a higher interest rate markup. The coordinated investigations by the department and the CFPB that preceded todays settlement determined this system of subjective and unguided pricing discretion directly results in Allys qualified African-American, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander borrowers paying more than qualified non-Hispanic white borrowers.NoneNone Todays settlement represents the first resolution of the departments joint effort with the CFPB to address discriminatory auto lending practices. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act gave both the DOJ and the CFPB authority to take action against large banks like Ally for violating the ECOA. Although the department has filed previously filed lawsuits alleging violations of ECOA involving car loans, today is the first ECOA lawsuit against an auto lender that operates nationwide.NoneNoneNoneNone
