    WASHINGTON  The Attorney General made the following statement today:     During my tenure as both Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, it has been a privilege to work closely with Director Harley Lappin. For more than a quarter of a century, including eight years as Director, his service to the Bureau of Prisons has helped improve public safety, strengthen our corrections systems, and advance the Justice Departments most critical goals.     Throughout his career, Director Lappin has lent his invaluable insights and expertise to address prison overcrowding and expand prisoner development and rehabilitation programs. He has worked tirelessly to provide people who have committed crimes with the job skills and educational opportunities necessary to make positive contributions once they reenter our communities. Despite growing demands and unprecedented public safety, national security, and budgetary challenges, he has consistently found ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency. In addition to acting as a sound steward of taxpayer dollars, he has also served as an example of integrity and professionalism.      I am grateful for Director Lappins wise counsel, as well as his dedication to the Justice Department. And I am certain that, for years to come, the Bureau of Prisons and the American people will continue to benefit from his enduring contributions.
