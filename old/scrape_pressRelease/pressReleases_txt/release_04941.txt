None"With this filing, the Department of Justice is taking an important step to ensure the safety and constitutional rights of young people incarcerated at Rikers Island," said Attorney General Holder. "We've seen alarming evidence of unnecessary and excessive use of force against juveniles, as well as a systemic failure to protect them from violence and deeply troubling -- and potentially scarring -- use of solitary confinement. This action allows the Justice Department to seek necessary reforms to remedy these unlawful conditions, to ensure fair treatment, and to provide all incarcerated young people with the protections, and opportunities to build better futures, that they deserve."Today we are taking legal action to ensure that critically important reforms are put in place to address the culture of violence and overuse of punitive segregation at Rikers Island that has violated the constitutional rights of New York Citys youngest inmates, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Gupta. We stand ready to work with the city to remedy these deeply disturbing conditions for the safety of confined youth, remedies that will ultimately also promote public safety and the safety of correctional officers.Sometimes its the case that bureaucracy can get in the way of reform-minded thinking and comprehensive cultural change, said U.S. Attorney Bharara. We hope that wont be the case here. We welcome the aspirations articulated by Commissioner Ponte but we hope those aspirations will find concrete expression in the form of permanent, enforceable, and verifiable terms in a court-approved settlement agreement. The devil, as they say, is in the details and we have come to the conclusion that joining the pending case as a formal party is the best and most efficient way to get those details done. That is why we are now taking the steps necessary to carry out our responsibility under the law. Given the longstanding sad state of affairs at Rikers Island, our impatience is more than understandable. As Ive said before, one way or another, we will get enduring and enforceable reform at Rikers Island.On August 4, 2014, the department issued a report that concluded that a deep-seated culture of violence is pervasive throughout the adolescent facilities at Rikers, and DOC staff routinely use force not as a last resort, but instead as a means to control the adolescent population and punish disorderly or disrespectful behavior. The report urged the city to adopt and implement over 70 specific remedial measures. Although DOCs new leadership has taken some positive steps in response to the report with respect to the 16 and 17-year old population, including reducing the inmate-to-staff ratio, developing new programming, and moving towards eliminating the use of punitive segregation, much more needs to be done.NoneSpecifically, the complaint alleges:Staff use force against young inmates with alarming frequency.In Fiscal Year 2014, there were 553 reported staff use of force incidents involving young inmates at the Robert D.Davoren Center (RNDC) and the Eric M.Taylor Center (EMTC), the two facilities that housed most young inmates.These incidents resulted in 1,088 injuries.Inmate-on-inmate fights and assaults are pervasive in large part because inmates are inadequately supervised by inexperienced and poorly trained officers.In Fiscal Year 2014, there were 657 reported inmate-on-inmate fights involving young inmates at RNDC and EMTC.Staff use of force and inmate-on-inmate fights and assaults have resulted in an alarming number of serious injuries to young inmates, including broken jaws, broken orbital bones, broken noses, long bone fractures, and lacerations requiring stitches.Staff frequently punch, strike, or kick young inmates in the head or facial area.Force is used as a means to punish young inmates, and staff unnecessarily continue to use force against inmates who already have been restrained.Force is used in response to inmate verbal taunts and insults.Specialized response teams, including probe and cell extraction teams, use excessive force.Staff regularly tell inmates to stop resisting, even though the inmate has been completely subdued, to justify the use of force.Use of excessive force is common in areas outside video surveillance coverage.DOC recently transferred many 18-year old inmates to housing units that have no video surveillance at all.The complaint further alleges that, notwithstanding a long and troubled history of pervasive use of force against inmates at Rikers, the city has for years failed to address systemic deficiencies, including:Failure to ensure that use of force is accurately reported, and allowing a powerful code of silence to persist.Failure to conduct thorough and comprehensive investigations into use of force incidents.Failure to appropriately discipline staff for using excessive and unnecessary force.Failure to ensure that inmates are adequately supervised.Failure to implement an adequate age-appropriate classification system.Failure to provide staff with effective training on the proper use of force and how to appropriately manage youth.In addition, the complaint asserts that the city has engaged in a pattern and practice of placing young inmates in punitive segregation at an alarming rate and for excessive periods of time.NoneU.S. Attorney Bharara thanked the Board of Correction for its continuing assistance in connection with this matter.This case is being handled by the Offices Civil Rights Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey K. Powell and Emily E. Daughtry are in charge of the case.
