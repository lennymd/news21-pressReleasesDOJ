The Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the state of Arkansas today announced that the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas, will spend more than $200 million over the next 12 years on upgrades to its sewer collection and treatment system to reduce discharges of raw sewage and other pollutants into local waterways. Under a settlement filed in federal court in the Western District of Arkansas, Fort Smith will also pay a $300,000 civil penalty and spend $400,000 on a program to help qualified low-income residential property owners to repair or replace defective private sewer lines that connect to the city collection system.This settlement will achieve long overdue improvements in the citys sewer system that will substantially reduce the number of sewage discharges and help assure that the citizens of Fort Smith reside in a safe and clean environment, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Sam Hirsch for the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resource Division.Todays agreement resolves alleged Clean Water Act violations related to Fort Smiths failure to properly operate and maintain its sewer collection and treatment system. Since 2004, Fort Smith has reported more than 2,000 releases of untreated sewage from its municipal sewage system, resulting in more than 119 million gallons of raw sewage flowing into local waterways, including the Arkansas River. These types of releases, known as sanitary sewer overflows, cause serious water quality and public health problems. Fort Smith also violated limits for discharges of various pollutants from its Massard and P Street wastewater treatment plants numerous times over the last decade.This agreement means cleaner water for the residents of Fort Smith by reducing pollution flowing into local waterways, said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. EPA works with communities like Fort Smith to develop cost-effective and pragmatic solutions to protect residents from exposure to raw sewage.Many of the manholes and pump stations from which Fort Smiths sanitary sewer overflows occur are located in low-income and minority communities.To reduce sanitary sewer overflows Fort Smith will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its sewer system to identify defects and places where stormwater may be entering the system. The city will also repair all sewer pipe segments and manholes that are likely to fail within the next 10 years, develop projects to improve its sewers performance and implement a program to reduce the introduction of fats, oil and grease into its system, to reduce root intrusion, and to clean the system of debris which can cause sanitary sewer overflows. Fort Smith will also implement a program to determine whether human waste is entering and being released from the citys stormwater system.The implementation of the consent decree will reduce releases of approximately 3,492 pounds of total suspended solids, 3,343 pounds of biological oxygen demand, 543 pounds of nitrogen, and 78 pounds of phosphorus from the Fort Smith sewage system each year. High levels of these pollutants can reduce oxygen levels in water bodies, which can threaten the health of aquatic plants and animals. Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water cause algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle. Large growths of algae, known as algal blooms, contribute to the creation of hypoxia or dead zones in water bodies where oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive.NoneKeeping raw sewage and contaminated stormwater out of the waters of the United States is one of EPAs National Enforcement Initiatives. EPA is working to reduce sanitary sewer overflows by obtaining commitments from cities to implement timely, affordable solutions.None
