  WASHINGTON  A federal court has permanently barred Robert Pendell from promoting any scheme that assists or advises customers to attempt to violate the tax laws, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order was entered by Judge Owen M. Panner of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. According to the government complaint, Pendell resides in Ashland, Ore. None   According to the court, injunctions were previously entered against Casternovia and Lyon. In recommending that Pendell be enjoined, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke cited a 2005 videotaped interview in which Pendell equated the payment of taxes to slavery and stated that SORCE products enabled customers to reclaim their sovereign rights. The court found that SORCE had at least 350 customers and, according to its internal records, made more than $1.6 million in 2005 through the sale of its programs. None
