  A federal jury in Detroit  convicted a Commerce Township, Michigan, woman of criminal contempt based on  violating an injunction that required her to comply with various legal tax  obligations, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced  today. None   According to court filings and  evidence presented at trial, Hendrickson and her husband, Peter Hendrickson,  filed federal income tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 on which they  falsely claimed they earned zero wages.  Based on these false returns, the IRS  issued the Hendricksons more than $20,000 in income tax refunds that they were  not entitled to receive.  In 2006, the departments Tax Division sued the  Hendricksons to recover these refunds.  As part of that case, Judge Edmunds  ordered the Hendricksons to file corrected amended tax returns for 2002 and 2003  that reported all of their income, and to repay their fraudulently obtained  refunds to the IRS.  Judge Edmunds also barred the Hendricksons from filing  additional false tax returns.   The Hendricksons false 2002  and 2003 income tax returns were the subject of a prior criminal prosecution.   In 2009, Hendricksons husband, Peter Hendrickson, was convicted of filing  multiple false income tax returns, including the 2002 and 2003 returns that he  filed jointly with his wife.  According to evidence presented at trial, these  tax returns were based on the false and frivolous theories that Peter  Hendrickson promoted in his book, Cracking the Code, and on his website, Lost  Horizons.  Doreen Hendrickson filed her false 2008 income tax return while her  husband was indicted for filing false tax returns.   The case was investigated by  special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation, and prosecuted by Trial  Attorneys Melissa S. Siskind, Jeffrey B. Bender and Jeffrey A. McLellan of the  Tax Division. None
