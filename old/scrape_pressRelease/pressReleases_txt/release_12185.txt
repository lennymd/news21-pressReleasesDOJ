  Willie Borden, a former Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department officer, pleaded guilty today to a criminal tax charge before U.S. District Court Judge James Robertson.  According to the court proceedings, Borden was the co-owner of B&B Security Consultants located at 1219 Good Hope Road, SE, in Washington, DC. B&B was in the business of providing security guards to various entities and events in the District of Columbia and throughout the metropolitan area.  Borden shared responsibility to collect, account for and pay over employment taxes for B&B. However, during 2002 through 2006, although Borden and his business partner withheld more than $2.1 million in payroll taxes from employee paychecks, they did not pay this sum over to the IRS, as the law requires.  Judge Robinson scheduled sentencing for Oct. 20, 2009. Borden faces up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and restitution for the unpaid employment taxes.  The case is being jointly prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Menzer from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia and Justice Department Tax Division trial attorney Karen E. Kelly. The case was investigated by the IRS Criminal Investigation Division.
