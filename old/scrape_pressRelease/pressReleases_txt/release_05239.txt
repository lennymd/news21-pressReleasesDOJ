Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement late Thursday after a federal district court ruled in favor of the Justice Department's lawsuit against Texas' voter identification law:"We are extremely heartened by the court's decision, which affirms our position that the Texas voter identification law unfairly and unnecessarily restricts access to the franchise. Even after the Voting Rights Act was seriously eroded last year, we vowed to continue enforcing the remaining portions of that statute as aggressively as possible. This ruling is an important vindication of those efforts."We are also pleased that the Supreme Court has refused to allow Wisconsin to implement its own restrictive voter identification law."This Department will never yield in its commitment to protecting that most sacred of Americans' rights - the right to vote."
