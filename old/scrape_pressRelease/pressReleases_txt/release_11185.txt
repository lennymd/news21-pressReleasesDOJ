Roberts was charged on March 25, 2010, in Alexandria, Va. He was also charged with failing to pay federal income taxes for 2003, 2004 and 2005.  According to court documents, Roberts has not timely filed an individual income tax return with the IRS since at least 1998, despite the fact that he was required to do so by law.

Between 2003 and 2006 he received between $42,388 and $146,344 in gross income each year and failed to pay the IRS a total of more than $90,000 in taxes for tax years 2003, 2004 and 2005.  No trial date has been set as yet. The charges against Roberts are only allegations. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Roberts faces a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.  Acting Assistant Attorney General John A. DiCicco and Neil H. MacBride, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, commended the investigative efforts of the IRS agents involved in this case. Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Caryn D. Finley and Justin Gelfand are prosecuting the case.None
