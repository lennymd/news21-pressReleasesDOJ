      Silford Warren, a resident of Queens, N.Y., was sentenced today to 24 months in prison for failure to pay over employment taxes in connection with his ownership of Silford Warren, CPA PC., the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. Judge William F. Kuntz II of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York also ordered Warren to pay $184,263 in restitution to the IRS.       Warren, a Certified Public Accountant, pleaded guilty on Dec. 9, 2011 to a one-count information charging him with willful failure to pay over employment taxes on behalf of his accounting business. According to the criminal information and court filings, from 2006 through 2008, Warren under-reported his employees salaries on tax filings with the IRS. The restitution amount ordered by the court included the employment taxes that he failed to pay over from his employees and his obligation, as an employer, to pay over a matching portion of those employment taxes, as well as the tax loss resulting from his filing false corporate income tax returns for 2005 through 2008.        Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Tino M. Lisella and Sean Delaney, who are currently on detail to U.S. Attorneys offices, and Assistant Chief Karen E. Kelly, who prosecuted the case.
