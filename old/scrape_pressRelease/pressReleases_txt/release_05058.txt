NoneThe Justice Department encourages law enforcement officials, in every jurisdiction, to work with the communities they serve to minimize needless confrontation, Attorney General Eric Holder said. It is vital to engage in planning and preparation, from evaluating protocols and training to choosing the appropriate equipment and uniforms. This is the hard work that is necessary to preserve the peace and maintain the public trust at all timesparticularly in moments of heightened community tension.The role of law enforcement is not only to enforce the law, but to preserve peace, minimize harm, and sustain community trust, said BJA Director Denise ODonnell. The resources available through this guide will help police departments and sheriffs offices maintain order and build effective police-community relationships, while promoting the rights and protecting the civil liberties of the citizens they serve.For many years, BJA and the COPS Office have developed guides, publications, webinars, checklists and tools for law enforcement agencies on community policing, building community trust, diversity training, privacy protections, and safeguarding first amendment rights. Building strong police-community relations requires a sustained effort over time, yet maintaining these relationships is exceedingly difficult during and in the aftermath of a high-profile incident or civil unrest. Professional law enforcement departments and effective operations require training and ongoing support from all partners. This guide helps law enforcement agencies locate these resources in one place, including in-person and online training opportunities, publications, reports, podcasts, and websites.Law enforcement officers are stewards of the peace and protectors of the people, but above all else, they are custodians of the public trust, said COPS Office Director Ron Davis. As a former police chief, I am proud of the work we are doing at the Department of Justice to help Americas public safety professionals carry out this sacred duty.NoneNoneNone
