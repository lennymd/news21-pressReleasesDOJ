NoneNone       Baer said that process and transparency matter.  They help ensure that enforcers views are exposed to informed reaction and that parties understand the processes used to reach a particular outcome. Baer also said that when fair and transparent decision-making processes are in place, the legitimacy of the agencys outcome is enhanced.         Baer encouraged newer antitrust enforcement agencies to adopt practices that would provide greater transparency and procedural fairness to parties in antitrust investigations.  Some of the practices recommended include providing parties under investigation with information about the timing of antitrust agencys decision-making, allowing parties to submit white papers and meet with investigating staff and decision-makers to present their views, and providing parties in investigations with regularly updated information about the agencys concerns.           The ICN roundtable was co-hosted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.  FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez also presented remarks.
