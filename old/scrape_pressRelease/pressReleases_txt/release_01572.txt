A Gulfport, Mississippi businessman was sentenced to 12 months in prison today for failing to file a 2009 individual income tax return, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division.  According to information provided to the court, Samuel Frazier, owned two companies in the Gulfport area: Frazier Fire Systems LLC and EZ Haul Demolition and Construction LLC. In 2011, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) special agents contacted Frazier, because he had not filed a tax return since 1997. Frazier failed to file a 2009 individual income tax return despite earning gross income of $618,253.53, an amount well above the threshold triggering the requirement to file. For tax years 2007 through 2010, Frazier caused a tax loss of $210,589.  In addition to the term of prison imposed, Frazier was ordered to serve one year of supervised release and to pay restitution in the amount of $210,589 to the IRS.  Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg commended special agents of IRS-CI, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorney Nathan Brooks of the Tax Division, who prosecuted this case. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg also thanked the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Mississippi for their assistance.  None
