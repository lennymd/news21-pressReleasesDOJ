Attorney General Jeff Sessions today notified all U.S. Attorneys Offices along the Southwest Border of a new zero-tolerance policy for offensesunder 8 U.S.C.  1325(a), which prohibits both attempted illegal entry and illegal entry into the United States by an alien. The implementation of the Attorney Generals zero-tolerance policycomes asthe Department of Homeland Security reported a 203 percent increase in illegal border crossings from March 2017 to March 2018, and a 37 percent increase from February 2018 to March 2018the largest month-to-month increase since 2011. The situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable. Congress has failed to passeffective legislation that serves the national interestthat closes dangerous loopholes and fully funds a wall along our southern border. As a result, a crisis has erupted at our Southwest Border that necessitates an escalated effortto prosecutethose who choose toillegally cross our border, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. To those who wish to challenge the Trump Administrations commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice. To the Departments prosecutors, I urge you: promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. You play a critical part in fulfilling these goals, and I thank you for your continued efforts in seeing to it that our lawsand as a result, our nationare respected. None Todays zero-tolerance policy further directs each U.S. Attorneys Office along the Southwest Border (i.e., Southern District of California, District of Arizona, District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, and the Southern District of Texas) to adopt a policy to prosecute all Department of Homeland Security referrals of section 1325(a) violations, to the extent practicable.
