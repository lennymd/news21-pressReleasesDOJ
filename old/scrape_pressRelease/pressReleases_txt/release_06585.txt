None       Ali Forouzan, of Mobile, Ala., pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in Mobile to making materially false and fictitious statements to a Special Agent of the FBI and a Department of Justice Antitrust Division prosecutor. The false statements were in regard to his knowledge of, and participation in, bid rigging and other fraudulent schemes in the Alabama real estate foreclosure auction industry.        According to the charge, in February 2012, Forouzan was interviewed, with counsel present, about the fraudulent schemes under investigation. Forouzan was aware of the nature of the investigation and knew that it was material for the FBI and the Antitrust Division to obtain his full knowledge of such unlawful acts as bid-rigging agreements and other fraudulent schemes relating to real estate foreclosure auctions; unlawful payoffs that he and others made and received in furtherance of such schemes; and secret, second auctions in which Forouzan and others participated. However, Forouzan willfully and knowingly provided false and fictitious information during his interview. None       The success of this investigation exemplifies the FBIs continued commitment to fight fraud in the real estate industry and serves to deter those who wish to illegally profit from fraud schemes, said Stephen E. Richardson, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Field Office. Special Agent in Charge Richardson praised the perseverance of agents and prosecutors in this complex investigation.       Including Forouzan, to date, nine individuals and two companies have pleaded guilty as a result of the departments ongoing investigation into the Alabama real estate foreclosure auction industry.NoneNoneNone
