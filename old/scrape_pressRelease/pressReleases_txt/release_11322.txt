  WASHINGTON    Jodi Hoskins, the operator of an escort service in Salt Lake City, Utah, has been found guilty of one count of tax evasion, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced. Judge Dee Benson issued his factual and legal determinations on Tuesday following a January 2010 non-jury trial.  According to the courts findings, Hoskins was actively involved in the management and operation of Companions, an adult entertainment agency or call-out escort service doing business in Salt Lake City, from its inception in 2000. Additionally, Hoskins was aware of all financial matters associated with Companions. Furthermore, it was understood by phone girls and escorts that they ultimately answered to Hoskins as their boss.  According to the courts findings, Hoskins lived a lavish lifestyle in 2002. She filed a joint income tax return with her husband, Roy Hoskins, in which she intentionally under reported the gross receipts of Companions by $1,204,354. The total tax due and owing resulting from the tax evasion for 2002 is $485,443.None  John A. DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended the special agents from IRS Criminal Investigation Division who investigated the case as well as Tax Division attorneys Monica Edelstein and Leigh Kessler who prosecuted the case.
