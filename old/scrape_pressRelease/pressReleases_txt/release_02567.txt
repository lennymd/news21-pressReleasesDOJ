An Alabama real estate investor pleaded guilty for his role in a conspiracy to commit mail fraud at public real estate foreclosure auctions held in southern Alabama, the Department of Justice announced today.Adrian J. Beach admitted that he conspired with others to, among other things, defraud financial institutions, homeowners and others with a legal interest in rigged foreclosure properties, out of proceeds from foreclosure auctions.

Financial institutions and homeowners suffered monetary losses as a result of the conspiracy.Adrian Beach schemed to rig home foreclosure auctions for his own benefit, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse, head of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. Real estate investors should know that the division and its colleagues in law enforcement will hold them accountable for conspiring to defraud banks and homeowners by depriving them of competitive auctions.Honesty and integrity in business practices are a hallmark of the American way and those who engage in illegal activities to obtain a business advantage which lines their pockets with ill-gotten gain will be held accountable by the FBI for their action, said FBI Mobile Division Special Agent in Charge Robert F. Lasky.Beach is the fourteenth defendant prosecuted in the Antitrust Divisions ongoing investigation of bid rigging and other fraudulent conduct in the Alabama real estate foreclosure industry.NoneNone
