NoneNoneNoneThe department has had an ongoing parallel lawsuit against Sheriff Arpaio and Maricopa County since May 2012. That lawsuit alleged four patterns or practices of unconstitutional conduct: discriminatory policing against Hispanic persons in MCSOs saturation patrols, general traffic enforcement and worksite operations targeting Hispanic immigrants; detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment during MCSOs worksite raids targeting Hispanic immigrants; failures in the provision of language access to Hispanic limited English proficient jail inmates; and retaliatory police action against critics of Sheriff Arpaio and MCSO.Last month, on July 17, the department entered into settlement agreements to resolve the claims in its lawsuit that were not addressed by the summary judgmentone agreement addressing MCSOs unlawful detentions and retaliation, and a separate agreement addressing MCSOs language access policies and practices in its jails. On the same date, the parties filed a joint motion requesting that the U.S. District Court of the District of Arizona approve and agree to enforce the settlement agreement concerning MCSOs unlawful detentions and retaliation. That motion is still pending before the court.None
