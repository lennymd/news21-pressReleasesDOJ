The Justice Department announced today that a federal district judge in Charleston, S.C. permanently barred Stacy Middleton from preparing federal income tax returns for others.According to the governments complaint, Middleton and a second defendant, George Jenkins, prepared federal income tax returns in Charleston through a business named MBM Tax and Accounting Services LLC. As alleged, Middleton prepared returns for his clients that unlawfully understated his clients income tax liabilities and overstated his clients refunds through a variety of schemes. The complaint alleged that Middleton prepared returns that unlawfully created fictitious deductions and credits as well as overstating and duplicating existing deductions and credits. The complaint further alleged that Middleton created fraudulent copies of Form 1099 on behalf of customers, creating fake income to enable Middleton to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit on behalf of his clients. According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examined 842 returns prepared by Middleton and Jenkins, and over 93 percent of those examinations resulted in an adjustment to their clients tax liability. According to the complaint, the IRS estimated that the U.S. Treasury lost as much as $55 million in revenue on account of Middletons and Jenkins misconduct.Middleton consented to the entry of the injunction. The governments claims remain pending against Jenkins and will be addressed in further court proceedings.NoneRelated Materials:None
