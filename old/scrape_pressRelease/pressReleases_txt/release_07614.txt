  Attorney General Eric Holder issued the following statement today on the resignation of U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana Jim Letten:     As the longest-serving U.S. Attorney in the country today, U.S. Attorney Jim Letten has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the people of his district and the nation by working tirelessly to make their communities safer through reducing violent crime, fighting public corruption and protecting their civil rights.      More recently, he and his office were instrumental in the department's efforts in ensuring that those who exploited the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina were held accountable.   He has been a valued partner, dedicated public servant and a good friend, and I am grateful for his service to the department over these many years.
