A federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, has permanently barred a Liberty Tax Service franchise owner from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order prohibits Christopher Paul Haynes from acting as a federal tax return preparer and from supervising, managing or employing federal tax return preparers. In addition, Haynes must provide the government with a list of all customers for whom Haynes or his business prepared a tax return for any tax year from 2010 to present. Haynes agreed to the civil injunction order entered against him.NoneNone
