The United States has filed a complaint against three related companies that bought and sold consumer credit reports, the Justice Department announced today. The governments complaint charges these companies with violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The companies have agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty to resolve these charges. None The complaint also alleges that the defendants did not take reasonable steps to identify the ultimate purchasers of the credit reports. In some cases, according to the complaint, the defendants sold lists to brokers who then re-sold them to unidentified entities. The sensitive financial information in credit reports must be protected from those who would use it to target vulnerable consumers for sham offers, said Stuart Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. We will work with the Federal Trade Commission to aggressively enforce the laws that safeguard these reports. Along with the $1.2 million civil penalty, the defendants agreed to injunctions against future FCRA and FTC violations in a proposed consent decree that must be approved by the court. The proposed order would prohibit the defendants from using, obtaining or reselling consumer reports for unauthorized purposes. The proposed order also would prohibit the defendants from selling consumer reports in connection with solicitations for debt relief and mortgage relief services that charge advance fees. None Acting Assistant Attorney General Delery thanked the FTC for referring this matter to the Department. The Consumer Protection Branch of the Justice Departments Civil Division brought the case on behalf of the United States.
