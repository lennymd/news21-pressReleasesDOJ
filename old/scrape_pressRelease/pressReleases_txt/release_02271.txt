A federal grand jury sitting in Charlotte, North Carolina, returned an indictment on Aug. 16, which was unsealed today, against a Monroe, North Carolina, resident charging him with one count of attempting to interfere with the due administration of the internal revenue laws and five counts of filing a false income tax return, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo, head of the Justice Departments Tax Division.According to the indictment, between approximately October 2007 through at least September 2011, Billy D. Floyd attempted to obstruct and impede the due administration of the internal revenue laws by filing numerous false Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms 1040X, Amended Individual Income Tax Returns, in an attempt to reduce his tax liability to zero. The indictment further alleges that Floyd submitted fictitious Surety Bonds to the IRS that falsely purported to satisfy his outstanding tax liabilities. Floyd also attempted to disrupt the public sale of property that the IRS previously seized by attempting to intimidate IRS employees conducting the sale as well as potential buyers. Following the termination of the public sale due to his actions, Floyd also filed a lien against the property in an effort to encumber it and prevent any sale by the IRS.If convicted, Floyd faces a statutory maximum sentence of three years in prison for each count in the indictment. He also faces a term of supervised release and monetary penalties.An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation and Trial Attorney Gregory Bailey of the Tax Division, who is prosecuting the case.
