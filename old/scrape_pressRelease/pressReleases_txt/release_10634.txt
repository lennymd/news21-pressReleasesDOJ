  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced that it has filed a lawsuit against the state of New York seeking relief to help ensure that military service members and other U.S. citizens living overseas have the opportunity to participate fully in the Nov. 2, 2010, federal general election and future federal elections. NoneNone   The state of New York submitted a waiver application on April 23, 2010, claiming that its Sept. 14, 2010, primary election date created an undue hardship that prohibited the state from complying with UOCAVA. On Aug. 27, 2010, the Department of Defense granted New Yorks waiver under the agreement that New York would transmit absentee ballots for the Nov. 2, 2010, federal general election to its UOCAVA voters no later than Oct. 1, 2010, and that absentee ballots would be accepted and counted up to Nov. 15, 2010.   Todays action was necessary because New York failed to mail ballots to its military and overseas citizens by the Oct. 1, 2010, deadline in the states waiver application in nine New York counties, including those comprising New York City. The lawsuit seeks a further extension of the deadline for counting UOCAVA ballots which will ensure military and overseas voters have a 45-day period to receive, mark and return their ballots. None
