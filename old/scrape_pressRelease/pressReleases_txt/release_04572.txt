NoneThe Department of Justice is proud to stand behind the fine law enforcement officers with the Des Moines Police Department who honored their badges by providing truthful information about the defendants criminal actions, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Gupta. We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable officers such as former officer Boone, who engage in willful uses of excessive force.This was a violent, criminal action stated U.S. Attorney Klinefeldt. Defendant Colin Boone kicked a defenseless man in the face. He will now be held responsible in the same way as all of the defendants he has helped put in jail. This was also a betrayal of trust: former police officer Colin Boone betrayed the trust of the public he served and of the officers with whom he served.The charge of deprivation of rights under color of law carries a statutory maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The sentencing hearing will be determined at a later date and Boone remains out of custody pending sentencing.Todays conviction is the result of an investigation conducted by the FBIs Des Moines Resident Office. Prosecution of this matter was handled by the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Southern District of Iowa.
