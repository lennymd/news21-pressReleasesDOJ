Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein today released the following statement on the shooting at the congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA:This morning, Members of Congress, Senators, congressional staffers, and Capitol Police officers were targets of a senseless and cowardly attack during a practice for a bi-partisan, charity baseball game. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We pray for their swift recovery. The Department of Justice will provide all resources necessary for a thorough investigation."I commend the heroic officers of the Capitol Police and the Alexandria Police Department. Their willingness to risk their lives to keep us safe is humbling and inspiring."
