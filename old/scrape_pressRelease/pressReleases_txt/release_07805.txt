None       The indictment was announced today by Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division; Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico; and Joseph Campbell, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI San Juan Field Office.       According to the five-count indictment, Rivera and Rodriguez, while acting under color of law, physically struck and assaulted Irizarry Perez and Irizarry Muniz with police batons, which resulted in bodily injury to both of them, and thereby deprived the victims of their constitutionally protected rights to be free from the use of unreasonable force by those acting under color of law.  Rivera, who was a sergeant at the time of the incident, was also charged with failing to intervene and keep the victims from harm when Rodriguez, an officer whom Rivera supervised, assaulted the victims in Riveras presence.  Finally, Rivera was charged for making false declarations to the federal grand jury related to Riveras actions and observations during the incident.  Although Irizarry Perez died as a result of injuries he sustained on Nov. 5, 2008, the indictment does not include charges that his death resulted from the defendants conduct.        If convicted, Rivera faces a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of four charged counts of civil rights violations and a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for one charged count of making false declarations before the grand jury.  Rodriguez faces a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of two charged counts of civil rights violations.        An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.       This case is being investigated by the San Juan Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jose A. Contreras from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Puerto Rico and Senior Litigation Counsel Gerard Hogan and Trial Attorney Shan Patel from the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
