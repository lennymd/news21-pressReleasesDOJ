According to the indictment, Daw participated in the mail fraud conspiracy beginning at least as early as December 2002 and continuing until at least April 2005.This action marks the fourth state in which a defendant has been indicted in our ongoing investigation into illegal conduct at public real estate foreclosure auctions, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Antitrust Division.
