None   The long road to passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 was paved with the footsteps of countless ordinary  Americans and well-known civil rights leaders who marched, held sit-ins, staged  boycotts and led freedom rides to end segregation and discrimination.  The call  for comprehensive civil rights legislation gained momentum in 1963, as civil  rights activists continued to organize peaceful demonstrations throughout the  country.  After hundreds of nonviolent protestors were met with police violence  and arrest in Birmingham, Alabama, President John F. Kennedy delivered a  nationally televised speech voicing his support for comprehensive civil rights  legislation.  After President Kennedys assassination in November 1963,  President Lyndon B. Johnson made a commitment to pursue passage of civil rights  legislation.  And after the longest debate in senate history, the Civil Rights  Act was finally passed and signed into law, becoming the first of many  legislative victories over the next 50 years that have been critical tools for  protecting civil rights. None   The event will include a  temporary display of original pages from the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on loan  by the United States Archives.
