Joseph Arigo, 47, a former sergeant with the Fulton Police Department in Fulton, New York, was sentenced today in federal court to 15 months in prison and three years probation for beating a handcuffed man inside the Fulton police station. In September 2014, Arigo pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.According to court documents filed in connection with his guilty plea, Arigo was sitting at the sergeants desk on June 28, 2014, when a handcuffed man, G.B., was brought into the police station. G.B. was yelling, but was not physically threatening any officers or himself. Arigo pulled the video camera out of the wall to stop it from recording, walked into the room where G.B. was, shoved his head into the bench and punched him in the head multiple times. G.B. suffered cuts and bruising, lost consciousness and required seven stitches. After the incident, Arigo lied to his supervisors and in two official reports in an attempt to conceal his actions.This case was investigated by the Syracuse Resident Agency of the Albany Division of the FBI and was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
