A settlement agreement was filed in U.S. District Court in Denver resolving a complaint alleging that two employers, Delaware Resource Group of Oklahoma LLC (DRG), and FlightSafety Services Corporation (FlightSafety), violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) by not paying money into two U.S. Air Force veterans 401(k) plans, announced Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez and U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado John Walsh.USERRA prohibits employers from discriminating against or taking any adverse employment action against any person because that person has performed service in the uniformed services. USERRA also allows returning service members to make catch up contributions to their civilian employers 401(k) retirement plans, and receive the employers matching contributions that were missed while they were on military leave. The Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys Offices have given a high priority to the enforcement of service members rights under USERRA.The two veterans, Michael J. Sipos and Gary D. Smith, are the plaintiffs in this case. According to the complaint, their employers, DRG and FlightSafety, violated USERRA by not allowing the veterans to make catch up contributions to their companys 401(k) plans upon their return from duty and not matching contributions that the veterans missed while on active duty in the Air Force. None We rely on our servicemembers to protect us, and the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that their civilian employment benefits are protected as well, said Assistant Attorney General Perez. The department commends FlightSafety and DRG for agreeing to resolve this matter amicably without contested litigation, which shows a good faith commitment by the companies to ensure that they are in compliance with USERRA.NoneNone
