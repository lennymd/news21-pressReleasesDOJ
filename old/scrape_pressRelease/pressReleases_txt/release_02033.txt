NonePacific Breeze Fisheries admitted that its engineers failed to document the illegal dumping of oily bilge water into the waters off American Samoa without the use of required pollution prevention equipment. These discharges occurred on at least two occasions, in 2014 and 2015, before the vessel brought fish to a cannery in the port of Pago Pago, American Samoa.The company further admitted that between October 2013 and July 2015, senior engineers regularly failed to accurately record the transfer and disposal of oil waste in the vessels Oil Record Book. The U.S. Coast Guard relies on such records to determine whether vessels are illegally dumping oil at sea. As a result, tons of oil sludge, waste oil and oily bilge water that were produced by the vessel remain unaccounted for.The company pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan for the District of Columbia to four felony violations of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, for failing to accurately maintain an Oil Record Book and for illegally discharging oily bilge water into the South Pacific. Under the terms of the plea agreement, the company will pay a $1.6 million fine, in addition to a community service payment of $400,000 for use in the National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa. Though Pacific Breeze Fisheries does not currently manage any active fishing vessels, the company also agreed to implement an extensive environmental compliance plan in the event it resumes operations.NoneThe case against Pacific Breeze Fisheries was investigated by U.S. Coast Guard personnel in American Samoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia. The case was prosecuted by Senior Trial Attorney Kenneth E. Nelson and Trial Attorney Brendan Selby of the Environmental Crimes Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick W. Yette of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia.
