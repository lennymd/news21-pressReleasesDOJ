The Justice Department announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against the owner and operator of the Heritage Point mobile home park in Montgomery, Ala., alleging that the companies and their employees or officers discriminated against African-Americans. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, names several defendants, including Lawrence Properties Inc., which manages Heritage Point, William Bounds, the district supervisor for Lawrence Properties, Lawrence at Lakewood LLC, which owns the property and Michael Lawrence, the president of the Lawrence at Lakewood, LLC. The complaint alleges that Lawrence instructed property managers not to rent to African-American applicants at Heritage Point or other mobile home parks managed by Lakewood throughout Alabama and Georgia. No one should be prevented from living in a mobile home park or anywhere else just because of their race, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. It takes courage to come forward and report such discrimination. We will continue to defend the rights of those who step forward to report discrimination by holding owners and managers who violate the law accountable for their discriminatory conduct. Our Fair Housing laws protect mobile home park residents just as they do all other people seeking to rent or buy a home or seek a home loan,stated John Trasvia, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. HUD and DOJ are committed to combating all violations of the Fair Housing Act. The lawsuit seeks an order prohibiting the defendants from engaging in future unlawful discrimination. It also seeks the payment of a civil penalty and monetary damages for the persons who were refused the opportunity to rent at Heritage Point because of their race. None
