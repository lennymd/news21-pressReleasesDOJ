NoneAccording to the one-count felony indictment filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, Kemp & Associates Inc. and its co-owner and vice president, Daniel J. Mannix, conspired with a competitor to suppress and eliminate competition by agreeing to allocate customers of heir location services sold in the United States between 1999 and 2014.Heir location firms identify people who may be entitled to an inheritance from the estate of someone who died without a will. The heir location firms then enter into agreements with those people to help secure their inheritances in exchange for a fee.For over a decade, the defendants schemed to line their pockets at the expense of beneficiaries, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. These charges underscore the divisions commitment to hold heir location services executives and their companies accountable for cheating heirs whose relatives died without a will.With todays charges, three executives and two companies have been charged as a result of the ongoing federal antitrust investigation into customer allocation, price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the heir location services industry, which is being conducted by the Antitrust Divisions Chicago Office and the FBIs Salt Lake City Division, with assistance from the U.S. Attorneys Office of the District of Utah and the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Northern District of Illinois.NoneKemp & Mannix Indictment
