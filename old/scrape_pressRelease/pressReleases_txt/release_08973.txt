    The Department of Justices Office of Justice Programs (OJP) today sponsored a forum of policymakers from all 50 states to focus on improving success rates for people released from prison.  The event positioned states to set goals, or to expand on existing goals, for reducing recidivism through cost-effective strategies in their communities.       In this time of economic challenges, we must continue to use every tool and strategy at our disposal to protect the American people while reducing costs to taxpayers, said Attorney General Eric Holder. Todays national forum demonstrates the Justice Departments firm commitment to working with its partners in the states and non-governmental organizations to improve public safety by supporting efforts to assist formerly incarcerated people as they return to their communities to become productive members of our society.

Robinson.  Todays forum allows corrections directors and policymakers to come together to brainstorm ideas and set measurable goals for significant reductions in recidivism.       A Pew Center on the States report presented today demonstrated that reducing states recidivism rates by just 10 percent could collectively save states more than $635 million a year in averted prison costs.  Experts pointed to research showing how certain strategies can help reduce recidivism, including concentrating supervision and treatment resources on those most likely to reoffend.   NoneNone
