The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued the following statement regarding the FBI's release of the transcript related to the Orlando shooting:The purpose of releasing the partial transcript of the shooter's interaction with 911 operators was to provide transparency, while remaining sensitive to the interests of the surviving victims, their families, and the integrity of the ongoing investigation. We also did not want to provide the killer or terrorist organizations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda. Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime. As much of this information had been previously reported, we have re-issued the complete transcript to include these references in order to provide the highest level of transparency possible under the circumstances.Transcript of Orlando Police Department 911 Calls, June 12, 2016None(OD) Orlando Police Dispatcher(OM) Omar MateenOD: Emergency 911, this is being recorded.OM: In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficent [Arabic]OD: What?OM: Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God [Arabic].
