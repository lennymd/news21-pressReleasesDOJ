The Justice Department reached an agreement today with Sunny Grove Landscaping & Nursery Inc. (Sunny Grove), a landscaping company in Ft. Myers, Florida. The settlement resolves the departments investigation of Sunny Grove for discrimination against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).Under the settlement agreement, Sunny Grove will pay $7,500 in civil penalties to the United States and undergo department-provided training on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA. Sunny Grove will be subject to departmental monitoring and reporting requirements.The Civil Rights Division is committed to protecting work-authorized individuals from discriminatory practices in the employment eligibility verification process, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. We commend Sunny Grove for working cooperatively with the division to resolve this matter.The investigation found that Sunny Grove discriminated against lawful permanent residents by requiring them to produce permanent resident cards to prove their work authorization, whereas U.S. citizens were permitted to choose whatever valid documentation they wanted to prove their work authorization. Lawful permanent residents do not have to show their permanent resident cards when they start working. Like all workers, they can choose whatever valid documentation they want to establish their employment authorization, and many lawful permanent residents have the same work authorization documents as U.S. citizens.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to: different documentary requirements based on their citizenship status, immigration status or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship status, immigration status or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral, should contact OSCs worker hotline for assistance.None
