None None The defendants agreed to settle the litigation and be bound by a consent decree of permanent injunction. The consent decree requires that if the defendants wish to resume manufacturing drugs or dietary supplements in the future, they must implement the remedial measures set forth in the consent decree, notify the FDA of the measures they have taken, and obtain written approval from the FDA that they appear to be in compliance with both the terms of the consent decree and the provisions of the FDCA.

Doing it in a way that jeopardizes their health and safety is a REALLY bad idea. We have a long history in the West of not tolerating snake-oil salesmen. This matter was handled by Trial Attorney Christopher OConnell of the Civil Divisions Consumer Protection Branch, with the assistance of Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Licht-Steenfat of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Colorado and Senior Counsel Michele Svonkin of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of General Counsel.
