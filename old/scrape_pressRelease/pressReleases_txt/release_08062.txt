U.S. District Judge Mark E. Fuller of the Middle District of Alabama also ordered Moss and Jenkins to pay over $120,000 in restitution, jointly and severally, to the IRS.        On Nov. 2, 2011, a jury found both Moss and Jenkins guilty of conspiracy and aiding and assisting the preparation of false tax returns relating to a tax preparation business owned by Moss named Flash Tax in Montgomery, Ala. The evidence at trial proved that both Moss and Jenkins, an employee of Flash Tax, prepared false tax returns for customers that fraudulently inflated the amount of refunds due to the customers. During the sentencing, Judge Fuller concluded the overall intended tax loss associated with the scheme was in excess of $7 million dollars.
