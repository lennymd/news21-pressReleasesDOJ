None  The court found that in 2008 and 2009 Marty prepared and filed fraudulent tax returns falsely reporting large fabricated amounts of federal taxes withheld. This false reporting of tax withheld led to fraudulent refund claims in amounts as large as $2.7 million per customer. The court also found that to support those fraudulent refund claims, Marty prepared and submitted false IRS 1099-OID forms on behalf of customers, showing the fabricated withholding.  The court stated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had identified approximately 110 returns that Marty prepared and filed that use false 1099 forms to make fraudulent refund claims. The court noted that Martys "scheme lacks any support under the Internal Revenue Code, case law, or any other authority."None  John DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked Tax Division trial attorney John Monroe, who handled the case, and Shauna Henline, of the IRS Small Business/Self Employed Division, who conducted the investigation.None
