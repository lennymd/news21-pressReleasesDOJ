  WASHINGTON - The United States has asked a federal court in Lincoln, Neb., to bar Donald Ondrak, a Lexington, Neb., CPA, from preparing tax returns, the Justice Department announced today. According to the government complaint in the case, Ondraks firm, Don Ondrak PC, prepares federal income tax returns for customers that unlawfully understate income and employment tax liabilities by under-reporting income, overstating expenses and claiming improper deductions for non-deductible personal expenses.  The government complaint also accuses Ondrak of helping clients use sham entities and bogus transactions in order to fraudulently understate their tax liabilities. According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service has examined approximately 400 returns that Ondrak prepared and found that a significant number of them understated the customers tax liability. The complaint estimates that the tax loss from Ondraks alleged misconduct between 2004 and 2007 could be in the tens of millions of dollars.None
