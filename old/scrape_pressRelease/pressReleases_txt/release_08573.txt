None       David Osborn, 40, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Richard G. Andrews in the District of Delaware.         According to statements made at todays hearing and documents filed in court, Osborn was identified by the FBI through reports of child pornography trafficking provided by AOL LLC to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).  Under federal law, internet service providers, such as AOL, are required to report suspected child pornography being transmitted over their servers to NCMEC, which then directs these cybertips to the appropriate law enforcement agency.  AOL reported that a particular online username, later linked to Osborn, had been used to trade images of child pornography with another computer user in South Florida.       On May 26, 2011, federal agents executed a search warrant at Osborns New Castle residence and arrested Osborn after finding more than 700 images of child pornography on his computer equipment.  Law enforcement agents also searched Osborns email account, which was found to contain numerous images of child pornography.  Osborns child pornography collection included images of girls, ranging from prepubescence to mid-teen age, engaged in various sexual acts or posing lasciviously.  Forensic data found on the equipment indicated that Osborn had been receiving and distributing images of child pornography for a number of years.  Also found on Osborns computer equipment were more than 500 internet chat logs between Osborn and others regarding child sexual exploitation.         According to information provided at court hearings, in the past, Osborn worked as a school bus driver, substitute teacher and with the Newport, Del., chapter of Jobs Daughters, a youth organization for girls.         At sentencing, Osborn faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Osborn also faces a term of supervised release following his prison sentence of five years to life, and will be required to register as a sex offender in any jurisdiction in which he lives, works, or attends school.  Osborn has been detained since his May 26, 2011, arrest.       This case is being investigated by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. McAndrew of the District of Delaware and Trial Attorney Andrew McCormack of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Justice Departments Criminal Division.   None
