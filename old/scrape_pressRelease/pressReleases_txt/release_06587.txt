Dennis, Special Agent in Charge, HHS-OIG, Office of Investigations, Miami Region.  Our increased investigative efforts in the Florida panhandle show that we will protect taxpayer-funded government health programs regardless of where perpetrators might be located.       Assistant Attorney General Delery thanked the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General; TRICARE Management Activity; the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Florida and the Justice Departments Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch for the collaboration that resulted in the settlement.         This settlement illustrates the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by Attorney General Eric Holder and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $14.8 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $10.8 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.None
