  WASHINGTON    The Justice Department announced today that it has filed suit against convicted tax fraud promoter Daniel Andersen to enjoin him from promoting fraudulent tax schemes. The governments complaint alleges that Andersen directed the activities of both the Institute for Global Prosperity (between 1996 and 2002) and the Stratia Corporation (between 2002 and 2004). The lawsuit states that Andersen used these organizations to promote the fraudulent tax schemes sold by others in a series of audio recordings and at offshore conferences.  Andersen, a co-founder of the Institute for Global Prosperity, was indicted in 2004 for conspiring to defraud the United States. He pleaded guilty in 2004, and in July 2008, a federal judge sentenced him to 30 months imprisonment for his offenses.  Global Prosperity orchestrated offshore conferences where individuals, which Global Prosperity touted as "experts," hawked numerous tax fraud schemes. According to the governments complaint, these vendors falsely told customers that they could revoke or relinquish their Social Security numbers using a U.C.C.-1 filing statement and that wages earned inside the United States are not subject to income taxes. The court papers state that Global Prosperity promoted and sold its products through a multi-level marketing system that rewarded existing salespeople for recruiting new salespeople.NoneNone
