    Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Wednesday on the resignation of U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan for the Western District of Washington:     "As United States Attorney for Western Washington, Jenny has served as a tireless advocate for the American people, for the citizens of Washington state, and for the cause of justice.    Over the years, she has demonstrated remarkable skill in guiding complex litigation, fostering interagency coordination, and combating a wide range of criminal activities.  Jenny has been an exceptional leader in the Justice Departments fight against cyber-crime and our work to protect the civil rights of all Americans.  And with a strong focus on education, prevention, treatment, and community outreach, she launched one of the first federal drug courts.     Jenny Durkan exemplifies the highest standards of personal integrity and professional excellence.  For the past five years, I have been grateful for Jennys dedicated service and her wise counsel.  I am certain that the people of Western Washington will continue to benefit from her service for years to come.  And although I wish her the very best as she takes the next step in her career, I will miss her leadership, her contributions, and her friendship.
