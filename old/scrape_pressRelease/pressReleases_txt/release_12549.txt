  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice today announced the transfer to the United Kingdom of Binyam Mohammed, an Ethiopian national and former resident of the United Kingdom who had been held at the Guantanamo detention facility since 2004.  As directed by the Executive Order issued by President Obama on January 22, 2009, an interagency panel has reviewed Mohammeds case and determined that his transfer, pursuant to an arrangement between the United States and the United Kingdom, is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice.  "The friendship and assistance of the international community is vitally important as we work to close Guantanamo, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the British government to work with us on the transfer of Binyam Mohammed," said Attorney General Eric Holder.  Mohammed is the first Guantanamo detainee to be transferred under the review of all Guantanamo detainees directed by the President. He departed Guantanamo aboard a United Kingdom aircraft Sunday night and arrived in the United Kingdom today.
