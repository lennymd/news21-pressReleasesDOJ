The Justice Department announced today that, as part of its Barrier-Free Health Care Initiative, it has reached a settlement with Castlewood Treatment Center LLC, of St. Louis, Mo., under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The settlement resolves allegations that Castlewood Treatment Center violated the ADA by refusing to treat a woman for a serious eating disorder because she has HIV. This is the second settlement addressing HIV discrimination by a medical provider reached by the Justice Department in two weeks.The Justice Department found that Castlewood refused to treat Susan Gibson because of her HIV, despite Castlewoods determination that she was qualified to receive counseling treatment for her eating disorder, and despite advice from its own medical staff that they were able to treat someone with HIV at Castlewood. The department also determined that for months Castlewood staff told Gibson that she was on a waiting list for the program, even though they had no intention to admit her into the program. In the meantime, Gibsons condition worsened and her health declined. Castlewoods actions delayed Gibson from receiving appropriate medical treatment for up to seven months. Gibsons complaint was brought to the Justice Departments attention by the American Civil Liberties Union, LGBT & AIDS Project.Excluding a person from necessary medical treatment solely because of HIV is unconscionable, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division takes HIV discrimination in any form seriously, and will not allow for the marginalization of those living with HIV.Under the settlement, the Castlewood Treatment Center must pay $115,000 to Gibson and $25,000 in civil penalties. In addition, Castlewood must train its staff on the ADA and develop and implement an anti-discrimination policy. The department will monitor Castlewoods compliance for four years.NoneNoneCastlewood Settlement Agreement
