      WASHINGTON  Robert G. Murdock, 64, of Southfield, Mich., pleaded guilty today to tax evasion, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.  According to documents filed with the court, Murdock owned and operated a childrens day care center in Detroit called Kids Expectations, a Detroit elementary school called Metropolitan Academy of Detroit, and a payroll company called Metro Teaching Staff at various times from 1997 through 2007.   During this period, Murdock accumulated unpaid federal payroll tax liabilities for his three businesses. When the IRS attempted collection actions such as levying on the corporate bank accounts, Murdock would incorporate new entities, often with similar names, obtain new Employer Identification Numbers for them from the IRS, and open new bank accounts, all for the purpose of moving assets out of the reach of the IRS.        According to the plea agreement, Murdock also evaded his personal taxes by filing false documents with the IRS and paying for personal expenditures out of business bank accounts and providing false information to IRS employees.       Murdock faces a potential maximum prison sentence of five years, a fine of up to $250,000 and restitution to the IRS of $200,000.  Sentencing was set for Feb. 14, 2012.       Barbara McQuade, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan; John A. DiCicco, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division; and Erick Martinez, Special Agent In-Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation made the announcement.       The case was investigated by Special Agents of the IRS - Criminal Investigation Division. Trial Attorney Shawn T. Noud of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ross MacKenzie prosecuted the case. None
