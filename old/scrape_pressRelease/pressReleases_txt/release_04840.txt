A federal court in Philadelphia has permanently barred a woman and her business from preparing tax returns for others and from operating a tax return preparation business, the Justice Department announced today.The injunction order, which was signed by U.S. District Judge Lawrence F. Stengel, also requires Denise Almanza to close her existing tax preparation business, Denises Centro De Servicios P.C.NoneSpecifically, the suit alleged that Almanza improperly claimed the additional child tax credit on customers income tax returns, which allowed her customers to receive, on average, over $2,900 in improper benefits per tax return. Almanza and her business have prepared more than 14,000 federal tax returns since 2010, according to the complaint. In total, the complaint alleged that Almanzas activities over the last four years have potentially cost the U.S. Treasury millions of dollars in lost tax revenue.None
