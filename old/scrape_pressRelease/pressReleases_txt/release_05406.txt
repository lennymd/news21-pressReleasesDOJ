    Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Wednesday on the departure, effective September 15, of Associate Attorney General Tony West:     Since returning to the Justice Department in 2009, Tony West has been an indispensable member of the Departments senior leadership team, an exemplary and dedicated public servant, and a close advisor and good friend.  His tenure as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division was defined by historic steps forward, including the Administrations decision not to defend the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act.  His service as Associate Attorney General has been marked by significant achievement  from his leadership in securing the landmark reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act; to his passionate advocacy for the rights of American Indian and Alaska Native peoples; to his tireless work to combat financial fraud, hold corporations accountable, and fight for American consumers.     Over the years, Tonys efforts have made a tremendous and lasting difference in the lives of millions of people across the country.  I have been honored to count him as a colleague  and privileged to work alongside him.  I thank him for his service, and his friendship, over the past five years.  And although I wish him the best as he opens an exciting new chapter in his career, I will miss his leadership, his many contributions, and his steadfast commitment to the cause of justice.
