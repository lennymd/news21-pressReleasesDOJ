The Justice Department and the city of Ferguson, Missouri, today jointly filed an agreement resolving the United States pending lawsuit against Ferguson. The court-enforceable decree, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, aims to remedy the unconstitutional law enforcement conduct that the Justice Department found during its civil pattern-or-practice investigation into the Ferguson Police Department (FPD) and the Ferguson Municipal Court. The departments findings were released in a public report issued March 4, 2015. The American people must be able to trust that their courts and law enforcement will uphold, protect, and defend their constitutional rights, said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. The filing of this agreement marks the beginning of a process that the citizens of Ferguson have long awaited  the process of ensuring that they receive the rights and protections guaranteed to every American under the law.Under the agreement, Ferguson will implement reforms to bring about constitutional and effective policing, promote officer and public safety, ensure fundamental fairness and equal treatment regardless of race in the municipal court and foster greater trust between police officers and the communities they serve. The areas covered by the agreement include:An independent monitor to be selected by the Justice Department and Ferguson will assess implementation of the consent decree, provide technical assistance to Ferguson and report on Fergusons implementation of reforms through periodic public reports. The consent decree requires two consecutive years of compliance by Ferguson before the agreement can be terminated.Ferguson residents and police officers deserve a law enforcement system that serves their entire community fairly, safely and effectively, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice looks forward to working closely with the city as we implement this landmark agreement to ensure that real reform becomes a reality for all people in Ferguson.NoneNoneNone
