None   The new policy means that the administration will no longer enforce statutory language governing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) that restricts the awarding of spousal benefits to opposite-sex marriages only. The language, contained within Title 38 of the U.S. Code, has, until now, prevented the Executive Branch from providing spousal benefits to veteransand in some instances active-duty service members and reservistswho are in same-sex marriages recognized under state law. None None   The decision not to enforce Title 38 aligns with the Obama administrations determination last year that two provisions of Title 38 that govern benefits for veterans and their families were unconstitutional as applied to legally married same-sex couples. At that time, the Attorney General informed Congress that the Department would no longer defend the Title 38 provisions, but that the Executive Branch would continue to enforce them. Todays announcement makes clear that enforcement of the provision in Title 38 defining marriage as between a man and a woman will now cease.NoneAttorney General Holder's Letter to Congress
