NoneNoneFISC ProceedingsNoneNone Yahoo! opposed the U.S. Governments motion to compel compliance with the directives primarily on the ground that the directives violated the Fourth Amendment rights of its customers. On April 25, 2008, following extensive briefing by the parties, the FISC held that the directives were lawful and ordered Yahoo! to comply. Yahoo! then appealed to the FISC-R.NoneFISC-R Proceedings On August 22, 2008, following briefings and oral argument, the FISC-R issued a classified opinion, affirming the FISCs decision that the directives were lawful. In its decision, the FISC-R first held that Yahoo! had standing to challenge the directives based on the Fourth Amendment interests of its customers that Yahoo! was alleging. Turning to the merits of the case, the FISC-R rejected Yahoo!s Fourth Amendment challenge to the directives. No rehearing or further review in the U.S. Supreme Court was sought. The FISA Amendments Act The PAA expired in February 2008 and was ultimately replaced with the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, codified as Title VII of FISA. The FISA Amendments Act incorporates many of the provisions and procedures that the FISC-R found important to its holding that the U.S. Governments surveillance was constitutional. The FISA Amendments Act also builds in additional safeguards that did not exist in the PAA. For example: The FISA Amendments Act, by requiring those and other safeguards, is even more protective of the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. persons than the statute upheld by the FISC-R as constitutional.
