    WASHINGTON  A federal court has permanently barred Martha A. Jones of Chicago from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  The civil injunction order, to which Jones consented without admitting the allegations against her, was signed by U.S. District Court Judge Gary Feinerman for the Northern District of Illinois. None     The complaint also alleged that Jones failed to sign her customers returns as the paid preparer, even after being advised by the IRS that she was legally required to sign them.  The court order requires Jones to provide the government with a list identifying all persons for whom she prepared federal tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2009. None
