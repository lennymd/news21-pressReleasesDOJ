WASHINGTON  Today, the Departments of Justice and Education released two new guidance documents  one for school districts and one for colleges and universities  detailing the flexibility that the Supreme Court has provided to educational institutions to promote diversity and, in the case of elementary and secondary schools, reduce racial isolation among students within the confines of the law. The guidance makes clear that educators may permissibly consider the race of students in carefully constructed plans to promote diversity or, in K-12 education, to reduce racial isolation.It recognizes the learning benefits to students when campuses and schools include students of diverse backgrounds. Diverse learning environments promote development of analytical skills, dismantle stereotypes, and prepare students to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world, said Attorney General Eric Holder. The guidance announced today will aid educational institutions in their efforts to provide true equality of opportunity and fully realize the promise of Brown v. Board of Education. Racial isolation remains far too common in Americas classrooms today and it is increasing, said Education Secretary Arne Duncan. This denies our children the experiences they need to succeed in a global economy, where employers, co-workers, and customers will be increasingly diverse. It also breeds educational inequity, which is inconsistent with Americas core values. None The guidance lays out legal standards under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which are enforced by the Departments. Previous guidance issued by the Bush Administration in 2008 is being withdrawn today. None None
