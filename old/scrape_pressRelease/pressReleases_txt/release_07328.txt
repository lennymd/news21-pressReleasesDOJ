The United States has asked a federal court in Camden, N.J., to bar Doris E. Baules, who operates DVazquez Tax Solutions, from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. According to the government complaint, Baules continually and improperly claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on her clients returns to enable them to receive erroneous tax refunds. The suit alleges that the defendant improperly increases their EITC claims.According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service previously conducted an investigation into the tax returns that Baules prepared for the 2009 tax year, and assessed $12,500 in return preparer penalties against her because she failed to exercise due diligence in determining whether her clients were entitled to the EITC. Baules continued to claim increased EITC on returns she prepared even after the IRS contacted her. According to the complaint, the total harm to the U.S. Treasury caused by Doris Baules misconduct is estimated to be as high as $6.2 million.NoneNone
