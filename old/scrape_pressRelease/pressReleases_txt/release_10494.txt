This guidance provides detailed information about the departments adoption of the 2010 Standards, including changes to the standards, the reasoning behind those changes, and response to public comments received on these topics.

Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the activities of places of public accommodation (businesses that are generally open to the public and that fall into one of twelve categories listed in the ADA, such as restaurants, movie theaters, schools, day care facilities, recreational facilities and doctors offices) and requires newly constructed or altered places of public accommodationas well as commercial facilities (privately owned, nonresidential facilities like factories, warehouses or office buildings)to comply with the ADA Standards.
