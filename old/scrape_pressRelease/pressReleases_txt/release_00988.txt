An Alaskan couple was charged in federal court in Juneau, Alaska today with four counts of willful failure to pay their individual income taxes, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder for the District of Alaska.  According to the Information, Archie W. Demmert III and Roseann L. Demmert earned income from commercial fishing. The Information alleges that Archie Demmert owned Vetta Bay LLC, which owned the Demmerts fishing vessel, the Emerald Beauty. The Information further charges that the Demmerts have a long history of not paying their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It alleges that the Demmerts did not pay their taxes for 13 separate tax years, for which they owed over $400,000, excluding penalties and interest. The Demmerts arraignment has not been scheduled yet. They face a statutory maximum sentence of one year in prison on each separate count, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Schroder recognized special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Steward and Trial Attorney Lori Hendrickson of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting this case.
