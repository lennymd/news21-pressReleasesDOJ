None   Limiting a childs exposure to potentially  traumatic events is an operationally sound and necessary law enforcement  strategy, said Deputy Attorney General James Cole.  It is also consistent with  law enforcements duty to serve the community as a whole.  It is an important  part of the principles of community policing, problem solving, and conflict  resolution. None   Trauma associated with the  arrest of a parent can have devastating and long term effects on the life of a  child, said Cecilia Muoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy  Council.  This administration is committed to advancing policies and programs  that support the children of incarcerated parents and ensure that their futures  remain bright with possibility.  Implementation of this new protocol, first  announced in 2013 during a White House Champions of Change event, will help  limit these children's exposure to trauma and encourage positive interactions  between members of law enforcement and the communities that they serve.   In addition to the development of  the model policy, IACP is developing a training curriculum that will be  delivered through webinars and a number of training sessions at conferences  around the country.   Police officers are confronted  with significant challenges and responsibilities when children are present or in  need of care and supervision following the arrest of a parent, said BJA  Director Denise E. ODonnell.  We are pleased to partner with IACP on a new  model policy that provides sound, practical, and child-focused guidance on how  police can join with their community partners to best meet the needs of children  in these difficult circumstances.
