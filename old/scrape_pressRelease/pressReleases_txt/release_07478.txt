     Craig Billings, 39, a former deputy sheriff with the Murray County Sheriffs Office in Sulphur, Okla., pleaded guilty today in federal court to a one-count information charging him with Deprivation of Rights for using unreasonable force and violating the civil rights of an individual who was being booked into the Murray County Jail.  None    Every person in America has the right to be free from excessive physical force when they are taken into custody by law enforcement officers, said Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez of the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division. While the vast majority of officers uphold this right on a daily basis, the Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division will vigorously prosecute officers who do not act in accordance with the Constitution.        Billings was remanded into custody at the time of his guilty plea. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set.    This case was investigated by the Ardmore Resident Agency of the Oklahoma City Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean Burris for the Eastern District of Oklahoma and Trial Attorney Fara Gold of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
