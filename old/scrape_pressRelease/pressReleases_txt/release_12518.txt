NoneNone  Mr. Rille and Mr. Roberts alleged that EMC submitted false claims to the United States for information technology (IT) hardware and services on numerous government contracts from the late 1990s to the present. The core of the relators allegations, in which the United States has joined by filing its own complaint, is that EMC made payments of money and other things of value (alliance benefits) to a number of systems integration consultants and other alliance partners with whom it had alliance relationships. The governments complaint asserts that these alliance relationships and the resulting alliance benefits paid by EMC amount to kickbacks and undisclosed conflict of interest relationships.  The government also alleges that EMC made false statements to GSA about its commercial pricing practices in order to obtain a higher price on its contracts thereby overcharging federal agencies purchasing EMC products and services.  Acting Assistant Attorney General Michael F. Hertz announced the Departments intervention in the suit and stated that the government joined the suit "as a part of the Department of Justices continuing efforts to ensure the integrity of the procurement process."None
