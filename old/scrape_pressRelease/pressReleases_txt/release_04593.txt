The United States filed a complaint seeking to bar a Doral, Florida, man and his businesses from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction complaint against Eleuterio Almanzar, Almanzar Tax Accounting & Consulting Corp. and Almanzar Financial Services Corp., filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Almanzar prepares federal income tax returns for customers that understate the tax that is due or seek refunds larger than are appropriate.NoneThe complaint also seeks to enjoin Almanzar from using a false or fictitious federally issued identification number  including social security numbers, Electronic Filing Identification Numbers, Employer Identification Numbers, Taxpayer Identification Numbers and Preparer Tax Identification Numbers  to file or remit federal income tax returns. The suit also seeks to prevent Almanzar from using any federally issued identification number that belongs to another person to file or remit federal income tax returns. The government is also asking to have Almanzar provide a list of customers that identifies by name, social security number, address, e-mail address, telephone number and tax periods all persons for whom he has prepared federal tax returns or claims for refund since Jan. 1, 2009.According to the complaint, the average tax deficiency for the returns the IRS examined since 2009 was $3,249 per return. Given the number of returns Almanzar has prepared since 2009, the harm to the United States caused by his practices could be in the millions of dollars.None
