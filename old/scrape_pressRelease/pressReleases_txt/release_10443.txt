None      According to the plea proceeding held today in U.S. District Court in New York City, James L. Hertz, a resident of Cranford, N.J., engaged in separate bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies related to the provision of a type of contract, known as an investment agreement, and other municipal finance contracts, including derivatives contracts, to public entities throughout the United States, such as state, county and local governments and agencies.  Hertz also pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.  According to the plea agreement, Hertz has agreed to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.         According to the court document, from approximately 1994 through approximately December 2007, Hertz worked in the municipal derivatives group of the financial institutions subsidiary as a vice president and a marketer of investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts.  The Manhattan, N.Y.-based financial institution was a provider of investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts, such as swaps, to public entities.  Public entities seek to invest money from a variety of sources, primarily the proceeds of municipal bonds that they issued, to raise money for, among other things, public projects.  Public entities typically hire a broker to conduct a competitive bidding process for the award of the investment agreements to invest such money.  Competitive bidding for these agreements is the subject of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and is related to the tax-exempt status of the bonds         The department said in court documents that Hertz was authorized to act as an agent of the financial institution in marketing investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts.  None      According to the court documents, Hertz also participated in a fraud conspiracy with a broker located in Minnesota from as early as 1998 until at least November 2006.  As part of this conspiracy, the broker gave Hertz information about the prices, price levels or conditions in competitors bids, a practice known as a last look, which is explicitly prohibited by U.S. Treasury regulations.  On some occasions, the broker signaled Hertz to change his bids to specific numbers so that his employer could make more money.  Hertz and co-conspirators also submitted intentionally losing bids to the broker for certain investment agreements to make it appear that his employer had competed for those agreement or contracts, when in fact, it had not.  As a result of the bid manipulation, Hertzs employer won investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts at artificially determined price levels, which deprived municipal issuers of money and property.       The court documents also charge that Hertz and co-conspirators misrepresented to municipal issuers or their bond counsel that the bidding process was in compliance with U.S. Treasury regulations.  This caused the municipal issuers to award investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts to providers that otherwise would not have been awarded the contracts if the issuers had true and accurate information regarding the bidding process.  Such conduct caused municipal issuers to file inaccurate reports with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and placed the tax-exempt status of the underlying bonds in jeopardy.     The bid-rigging conspiracy with which Hertz is charged carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.  The fraud conspiracy with which Hertz is charged carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The maximum fines for each of these offenses may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      This is the eighth guilty plea to arise from an ongoing investigation into the municipal bonds industry, which is being conducted by the Antitrust Divisions New York Field Office, the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation.  The department is coordinating its investigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.       Three former employees of Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Rubin/Chambers, Dunhill Insurance Services Inc. (CDR) have pleaded guilty to bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies in relation to the ongoing investigation.  Four other individuals have pleaded guilty to charges related to the ongoing investigation.  In addition, three former financial services executives were indicted on July 27, 2010, for participating in fraud schemes and conspiracies related to the bidding for investment agreements.  In October 2009, CDR, two of its employees and one former employee were charged for participating in bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies and related crimes.  The CDR trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 12, 2011.   None None
