None     Pole, of Waldorf, Md., was charged in an indictment returned on Dec. 15, 2009, by a federal grand jury in Washington.   According to evidence presented during his trial, Pole worked as the office manager for former U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy.   Poles responsibilities included transmitting salary information to the Senate Disbursing Office in order to adjust the pay of employees in the senators office.      According to evidence presented at trial, beginning in at least 2003 and continuing until January 2007, Pole repeatedly submitted paperwork causing the Senate to pay him larger bonus payments than had been approved by either the chief of staff or Senator Kennedy.   According to the evidence presented at trial, these unauthorized bonus payments totaled more than $75,000.   Pole hid the existence of these unauthorized payments by repeatedly transmitting information to the chief of staff that falsely showed that he received only those payments that had been authorized.
