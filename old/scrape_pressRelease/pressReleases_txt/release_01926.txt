Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on the planned departure of U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania:For the last six and a half years, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger has served the people of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania  and all of the American people  with great distinction. Under his outstanding leadership, his office has prosecuted terrorists, corrupt public officials, dangerous drug dealers and other violent offenders, child predators, human traffickers and perpetrators of serious fraud. He also has worked diligently to help the Department of Justice implement its Smart on Crime program to make our criminal justice system more fair and effective. During his time in office, he has helped  and encouraged other U.S. Attorneys offices across the country  to implement novel youth crime prevention and prisoner reentry programs as part of a three-part strategy to combat violent crime. And as a member of the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee and as chair of the committees Health Care Fraud Working Group, he has provided sound counsel and good judgment to both me and my predecessor, Attorney General Eric Holder. There is no doubt that our country is safer and stronger thanks to Zanes exceptional contributions and dedicated efforts. I want to thank him for his distinguished service and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
