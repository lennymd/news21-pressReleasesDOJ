A Detroit federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against two former executives of a Japanese automotive parts manufacturer for their participation in a conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids of automotive parts and for obstruction of justice for ordering the destruction of evidence related to the conspiracy, the Department of Justice announced today.NoneKomiya and Nakayama are also charged with knowingly and corruptly persuading, and attempting to persuade, employees of Mitsuba to destroy documents and delete electronic data that may contain evidence of antitrust crimes in the United States and elsewhere. These charges demonstrate the Antitrust Divisions continued commitment to prosecuting individuals who commit criminal antitrust violations, said Brent Snyder, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Divisions Criminal Enforcement Program. Because these same individuals committed the additional crime of obstructing the investigation, they also serve as cautionary tale for those who are tempted to try to thwart the Antitrust Divisions investigative activities by destroying evidence.Komiya participated in the conspiracy as Mitsuba Director of Automotive Sales. In 2007, he was promoted to Executive Managing Officer and Vice President of Sales. Nakayama was the Office Manager of Mitsubas Nagoya sales office. In 2005, he was promoted to Sales Operating Officer.NoneMitsuba is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Japan with its principal place of business in Gunma, Japan. On Nov. 6, 2013, Mitsuba pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a $135 million criminal fine for its role in the conspiracy as well as obstruction of justice.Including Komiya and Nakayama, 52 individuals have been charged in the governments ongoing investigation into market allocation, price fixing, and bid rigging in the auto parts industry. Additionally, 33 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty and have agreed to pay a total of more than $2.4 billion in fines.NoneNoneNone
