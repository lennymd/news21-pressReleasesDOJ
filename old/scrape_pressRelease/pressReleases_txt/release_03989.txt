Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates released the following statement after the clemency announcement made today by President Obama:Last year, the President asked the Justice Department to develop criteria for identifying and recommending for executive clemency those non-violent, low-level offenders who received harsh sentences they would not receive if sentenced today. The President's decision to commute the sentences of 46 more individuals today is another sign of our commitment to correcting these inequities. We will continue to recommend to the President appropriate candidates for clemency, and we will continue to work with Congress on recalibrating our sentencing laws for non-violent drug offenders.
