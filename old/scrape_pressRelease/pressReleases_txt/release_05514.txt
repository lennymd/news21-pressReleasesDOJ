  The Justice Department announced  today that Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) has agreed to pay $32.5 million to resolve  allegations under the False Claims Act that HP overcharged the U.S. Postal  Service (USPS) for products between October 2001 and December 2010.  HP is a  manufacturer and vendor of information technology products and services  headquartered in Palo Alto, California.   Protecting the federal  procurement process from false claims is central to the mission of the  Department of Justice, said Assistant Attorney General Stuart F. Delery for the  Justice Departments Civil Division.  We will continue to ensure that when the  government purchases commercial products, it receives the prices to which it is  entitled.   The United States alleged that  under a contract between HP and the USPS, HP overcharged USPS by failing to  comply with pricing terms of the contract, including a requirement that HP  provide prices that were no greater than those offered to HP customers with  comparable contracts.  The United States also alleged that HP made  misrepresentations during the negotiation of the contract regarding its pricing  and its plans to ensure it would provide the required most favored customer  pricing.   The Major Fraud Investigations  Division (MFID) within the Postal Service Office of Inspector General fully  investigates those contractors who wrongly take advantage of the Postal  Service, said Thomas Frost, MFID's Special Agent in Charge.  The Postal  Service and the public must have complete confidence in the procurement process  and MFID will continue to work diligently to make that happen.   This matter was jointly  investigated by the U.S. Postal Service, Office of the Inspector General and the  Department of Justices Civil Division.  The claims resolved by the settlement  are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.
