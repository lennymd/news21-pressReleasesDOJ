Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the following statement regarding Saturdays fatal shooting in Louisiana:We are all saddened to learn of the death on Saturday night of Sergeant Shawn Anderson, who was shot and killed while trying to question a rape suspect. His death adds to the sorrow of the law enforcement community in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which still mourns the killing last July of three officers during an ambush. The loss of Sergeant Anderson underscores the dangers that our men and women in law enforcement face willingly every day as they serve and protect us. We are forever in their debt, and we must do more to keep them safe. I will make available all of the resources of the department to aid the state and local authorities investigating this incident, and to ensure that the suspect who killed this brave officer faces justice. My thoughts and prayers, and those of the entire Department of Justice, go out to the family, loved ones, and colleagues of Sergeant Anderson.
