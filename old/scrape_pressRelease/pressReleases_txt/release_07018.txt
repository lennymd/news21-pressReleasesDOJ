This agreement will ensure that the departments officers and detectives are fully prepared to play that role.   The Justice Departments review of the Missoula Police Department was one of three simultaneous civil pattern or practice investigations into allegations that law enforcement was systematically failing to protect women victims of sexual assault in Missoula. Alongside its investigation of the Missoula Police Department, the Justice Department conducted parallel investigations of the Missoula County Attorneys Office and the University of Montanas Office of Public Safety.

The Justice Departments investigation of the Missoula County Attorneys Office is ongoing.None
