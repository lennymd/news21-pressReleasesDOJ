Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates today released the following statement on the passing of U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers:Today the Marshal Service lost one of its best. I had the privilege of working with Deputy Commander Carothers in Atlanta for many years and he more than lived up to his reputation for being an inspiring leader and an exemplary public servant. Deputy Commander Carothers was dedicated to his mission, devoted to his team and heroic to his core. For those of us lucky enough to see him in action, he set an extraordinary example of valor and decency in service to the American people. Losing him today is a blow to our law enforcement family in Atlanta and across the country and it underscores the grave risks that law enforcement officers assume every day in order to keep us safe. Deputy Commander Carothers was a hero not only to his colleagues, but also to the family he cherished and adored. His wife and children, and all of his loved ones will be central to my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. All of us at the U.S. Department of Justice owe it to them  and to the memory of Deputy Commander Carothers  to keep his spirit alive by continuing to fight for the values of security, peace and justice that animated his life and that will endure with his legacy."
