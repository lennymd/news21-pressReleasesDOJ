Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement Sunday on the passing of civil rights leader Julian Bond:Throughout his remarkable life, Julian Bond was a leader, a trailblazer, and an icon in this countrys enduring fight for civil rights and equal justice for all people. Bonds career reflects his extraordinary gift for turning conviction into action  from helping to establish the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Poverty Law Center to representing his community in the Georgia General Assembly; and from leading the NAACP to sharing his vision and intellect through his writing, teaching, and public commentary. I will never forget hearing Bond speak when I was a student in college, and he has remained a personal hero to me ever since. For me and for so many others, Bonds words and deeds reached into our hearts and inspired us to take up his noble causes of equality, justice, and freedom. The legion of committed and passionate advocates he leaves behind is just one of many ways that his legacy will live on  by advancing his ongoing work, by spreading his timeless message, and by lifting up his example for all to see for generations to come.
