  Following a jury trial that began on Aug. 1, 2012, a federal jury convicted Enyinnaya Udo on all 25 counts of an indictment charging him with aiding and assisting in the preparation of false individual income tax returns, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.     According to the indictment and evidence presented at trial, Udo operated a tax preparation business called Anic and Associates, located in Washington, D.C.   Udo prepared false 2005 through 2008 individual income tax returns for seven taxpayers, falsely reporting that the taxpayers had unreimbursed employee expenses.     U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein scheduled sentencing for Nov. 1, 2012.   Udo faces a potential maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on each count.  Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended the IRS Criminal Investigation special agents who investigated the case and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Jessica Moran and Erin Pulice, who prosecuted the case. Jason Scheff and Schylon Lane assisted with the prosecution.
