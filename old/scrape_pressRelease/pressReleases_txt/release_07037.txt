  At a hearing today in federal court in the Eastern District of North Carolina, Hysen Sherifi, 29, of Raleigh, N.C., was sentenced by Senior U.S. District Judge W. Earl Britt to life in prison. Sherifis co-defendants, Shkumbin Sherifi, 23, and Nevine Aly Elshiekh, 48, were also sentenced to 36 months and 42 months in prison, respectively, both followed by three years of supervised release.  The sentences were announced by John Carlin, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security; Thomas G. Walter, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina; and John Strong, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Charlotte Division.  Today, a convicted terrorist who plotted from his prison cell to behead federal agents and witnesses received the justice he deserved. As this sentence demonstrates, those who attempt to thwart the judicial process through violence will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I thank all those who worked to ensure that Hysen Sherifis original terrorist plans against U.S. military personnel and others were derailed, and that his subsequent murder-for-hire plot against those who testified against him was thwarted, said John Carlin, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  U.S. Attorney Walker stated, This case serves as an unfortunate reminder that we must remain ever vigilant in our efforts to detect violent extremists who seek to harm our people and property.None
