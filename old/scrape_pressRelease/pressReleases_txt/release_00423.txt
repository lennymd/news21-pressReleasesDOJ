The former chief financial officer (CFO) of ArthroCare Corporation, a publicly traded medical device company based in Austin, Texas, was sentenced today to 50 months in prison for his role in orchestrating a fraud scheme that resulted in shareholder losses of over $750 million.  Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John F. Bash of the Western District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs of the FBIs San Antonio Field office made the announcement.  Michael Gluk, 59, of Austin, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Sam Sparks of the Western District of Texas, who also ordered Gluk to pay a $50,000 fine and to forfeit $677,804.  On June 14, 2017, Gluk pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud. As part of his guilty plea, Gluk admitted that he conspired with others to falsely inflate ArthroCares sales and revenue through a series of end-of-quarter transactions involving ArthroCares distributors. He further admitted that he and other co-conspirators caused ArthroCare to file a Form 10-K for 2007 and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2008 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that materially misrepresented ArthroCares quarterly and annual sales, revenues, expenses and earnings. As part of his plea, Gluk further admitted that he provided false testimony in proceedings before the SEC and in federal district court.  The fraud scheme at ArthroCare began in 2005 and continued until 2009. Gluk admitted that he and his co-conspirators determined the type and amount of product to be shipped to distributors based on ArthroCares need to meet Wall Street analyst forecasts, rather than distributors actual orders. Gluk and others then caused ArthroCare to park millions of dollars worth of ArthroCares medical devices at its distributors at the end of each relevant quarter. ArthroCare reported these shipments as sales in its quarterly and annual filings at the time of the shipment, enabling the company to meet or exceed internal and external earnings forecasts. ArthroCares distributors agreed to accept shipment of millions of dollars of products in exchange for special conditions, including substantial, upfront cash commissions, extended payment terms and the ability to return products, allowing ArthroCare to falsely inflate revenue by tens of millions of dollars, Gluk admitted. Gluk admitted that he and his co-conspirators caused ArthroCare to acquire its largest distributor, DiscoCare, specifically to conceal from the investing public the nature and financial significance of ArthroCares relationship with DiscoCare.  None None This case was investigated by the FBIs San Antonio, Austin Resident Agency Office. The case is being prosecuted by Securities and Financial Fraud Unit Chief Benjamin D. Singer, Assistant Chief Henry P. Van Dyck and Trial Attorney Caitlin Cottingham of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.
