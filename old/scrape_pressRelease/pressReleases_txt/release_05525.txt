The Justice Department today announced the payment of more than $1.5 million in damages under a consent decree previously reached with QuikTrip Corporation. The payments were made by QuikTrip to compensate 47 individuals with disabilities who experienced discrimination at QuikTrip gas stations and convenience stores across the country, in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). QuikTrip owns and operates nearly 700 gas stations, convenience stores, travel centers and truck stops throughout the Southern, Midwestern and Southwestern United States. The consent decree, which was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska in July, 2010, required QuikTrip to make all of its facilities accessible, adopt accessibility policies and pay a $55,000 civil penalty to the United States. QuikTrip has made all changes required in the consent decree to make their properties ADA accessible. Today is an important milestone in making whole individuals with disabilities who experienced repeated and extensive accessibility barriers at QuikTrip facilities across the United States, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division. QuikTrip should be commended for working diligently with the department to overhaul its gas stations, stores and policies to comply with the ADA. Ensuring access to QuikTrip facilities by individuals with disabilities is a significant step by QuikTrip and a win-win resolution, said United States Deborah R. Gilg for the District of Nebraska. Individuals with disabilities will no longer encounter barriers to access at these facilities and QuikTrip can profit by providing services to this segment of our population. None
