   Montell Williams, of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in Hammond, Ind., to violating the Mann Act by transporting a woman across state lines for the purpose of having her engage in prostitution. Williams was indicted on Oct. 4, 2012 and indicted on additional charges on Dec. 13, 2012.   According to court documents, Williams admitted that on several occasions between June 2011 and Feb. 5, 2012, Williams drove an adult woman across state lines from Indiana to Illinois so that she could engage in prostitution.   Williams faces up to 10 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for April 25, 2013, before U.S. District Judge Rudy Lozano.
