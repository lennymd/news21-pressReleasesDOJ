None None   Our nation was founded on bedrock principles of religious liberty. The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously enforce civil rights laws that protect religious freedom, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.When a faith community follows the rules, as the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has done in seeking to construct its place of worship, it is impermissible to change the rules in a discriminatory way that prevents people of faith from exercising their fundamental right to worship.   The United States Attorneys Office will zealously protect every citizens right to worship and assemble, said Jerry E. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee. If we do not protect the rights of these congregants in Rutherford County, then the rights of all people are endangered and diminished.   The governments complaint seeks a court order requiring the county to act promptly on the Islamic Centers application for a certificate of occupancy despite the chancery courts injunction.   The case began when the Islamic Center, which has been operating in Rutherford County since 1982, sought to construct a new mosque for its growing congregation. In 2009, it purchased land for that purpose on Veals Road in Rutherford County and, in compliance with the countys zoning regulation, subsequently applied for site-plan approval. After considering the proposal at a regularly scheduled, advertised meeting, the county approved the site plan. Following the countys approval, opponents of the mosque filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to stop construction. Ultimately, with the exception of the plaintiffs public-notice claim, the chancery court dismissed the plaintiffs claims. None   The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegations must be proven in federal court.Complaint
