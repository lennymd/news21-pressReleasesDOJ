  The Justice Department, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration (TIGTA) announced that Matthew Bender, of Detroit, was sentenced  today by U.S. District Judge Julian Abele Cook Jr. to serve 48 months in prison  and one year of supervised release.   On March 18, after a  fourday trial, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the  Eastern District of Michigan convicted Bender of obstructing the IRS and of nine  counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal income tax  returns.  On June 4, another jury convicted Bender of failing to make a required  appearance in court.  Todays sentencing is for all of Benders convictions.   According to court documents and  evidence produced at trial, between 2006 and 2011, Bender prepared more than  3,000 tax returns and earned more than $500,000 in fees.  However, Bender failed  to report his own income from tax preparation to the IRS, either by filing false  tax returns for himself or by failing to file his own tax returns at all.  The  evidence also showed that Bender caused inflated tax refunds for his customers  by placing false deductions on their returns.   After the initial indictment  prior to his first trial, Bender was ordered by Judge Cook Jr. to appear in  court July 2, 2013, concerning his failure to comply with his conditions of  release.  Bender failed to appear in court on that date and was arrested in  August 2013 by the U.S. Marshals Service after returning to Michigan from  traveling to Ohio and Texas.   The case was investigated by  special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation and TIGTA.  Trial Attorneys  Jeffrey McLellan and Kenneth Vert of the departments Tax Division prosecuted  the case. None
