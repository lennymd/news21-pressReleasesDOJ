  Attorney General Eric Holder today announced the appointment of three new U.S. Attorneys to serve on the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee (AGAC): Sanford Coats of the Western District of Oklahoma; Steven M. Dettelbach of the Northern District of Ohio; and Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana.     I welcome the addition of these U.S. Attorneys to the AGAC, which plays a critical role in the department.   I will rely heavily on them as we workto further the departments efforts to reduce violent crime and gang violence, promote civil rights, ensure fairness in the marketplace and above all, preserve our national security, said Attorney General Holder.   The AGAC, chaired by U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota B. Todd Jones, was created in 1973.
