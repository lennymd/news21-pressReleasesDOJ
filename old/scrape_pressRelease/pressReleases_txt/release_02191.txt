Assistant Attorney General Karol V. Mason of the Justice Departments Office of Justice Programs (OJP) today announced funding of more than $34.5 million, through nine separate grant programs, to more than 40 jurisdictions, research institutions and other grantees, to reduce crime, improve community safety and provide a science-based approach to criminal justice operations.            Administered under OJPs Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Smart Suite of programs represents a strategic approach that brings more science into criminal justice operations by leveraging innovative applications of analysis, technology and evidence-based practices with the goal of improving performance and effectiveness while containing costs. The Smart Suite touches every aspect of the criminal justice system, from arrest to prosecution to reentry, relying on practitioner-researcher relationships that use data, evidence and innovation to enable jurisdictions to understand the full nature and extent of local crime challenges.During the Sept. 7, 2016, Smart Suite Summit, Assistant Attorney General Mason described the programs proven track records of helping communities target crime hot spots, promote neighborhood revitalization and increase public safety. She noted that Corning, Californiaa Byrne Criminal Justice Program grant recipientsaw a 30 percent decrease in violent crime since early 2015. Under the Smart Prosecution Initiative, the St. Louis, Missouri, Circuit Attorneys Office is now working with police, courts and local university researchers on a gun diversion program that targets individuals convicted of a felony.These successes are no accident, said Assistant Attorney General Mason. They happened because of a commitment to smart, sustainable public safety strategies grounded in data and research. These awards help communities pursue evidence-based and community partnerships to reduce crime and increase public safety.Grants awarded to specific jurisdictions under individual 2016 Smart Suite programs include the following:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone###None
