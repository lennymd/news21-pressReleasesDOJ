  WASHINGTON  Attorney General Eric Holder announced today that the Presidents FY 2010 budget proposal totals $26.7 billion for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to increase support for the Departments traditional missions while strengthening national security efforts.   The request represents a 3.8 percent increase in budget authority and an increase of 3,977 positions over the FY 2009 enacted appropriation.      The Presidents budget request demonstrates both a dedication to protecting our national security as the Department of Justices top priority and a renewed commitment to the Departments traditional missions, Attorney General Holder said. In these tough economic times, its more important than ever that we remain vigilant in the fight against crime while never relaxing our guard in the battle against global terrorism.None  The $26.7 billion budget request fully funds base operations and activities for all DOJ components and includes program enhancements totaling $1.94 billion.   Approximately 90percent of the total resources are dedicated to national security programs and DOJs traditional missions in law enforcement and litigation, while the remaining 10 percent funds state and local assistance programs.

The Administration is committed to providing communities across the country with resources to begin hiring 50,000 police officers.   The budget request includes $298 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program which, combined with the $1 billion provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable the hiring of more than 7,000 police officers nationwide by the end of 2010.   The budget also provides for significant funding toward the Second Chance Act, which attempts to break the cycle of criminal recidivism by providing services to ex-offenders before and after they are released from prison and return to communities.   The resources will fund prisoner reentry programs by providing an increase of $75 million in grant program and research funding, as well as an increase of $13.8 million for federal inmate skills development.   Increased state and local funding will be used to provide drug treatment, mentoring and other transitional services to help ex-offenders integrate into societyand lead productive lives. None None   The Department of Justice will continue to play a crucial role in the federal financial recovery effort through criminal and civil litigation. The budget includes $62.6 million for additional FBI agents, federal prosecutors, civil litigators and bankruptcy attorneys to address the problems that contributed to, and that are caused by the current financial crisis.   Within this enhancement are additional resources for the following Department components:    NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone   The FY 2010 budget provides for 50 additional FBI agents to combat financial fraud .   It also provides for 165 attorneys in Washington and in U.S. Attorney Offices throughout the United States to aggressively pursue cases in the civil and criminal court systems, defend the United States in high-profile, high stakes Indian Tribal Trust litigation and support programs that have high rates of return, such as debt collection, tax law enforcement and fraud enforcement. None NoneNone  Consistent with the Presidents commitment to defend the laws of the United States and protect civil rights, the budget requests $15.7 million, and 102 additional positions including 60 attorneys, to expand existing initiatives and reinvigorate traditional civil rights enforcement.   Additional staff allow for more vigorous pursuit of hate crimes and discrimination, human trafficking crimes and unsolved civil rights era crimes.   The budget provides for increased enforcement of fair housing and fair lending laws, disability laws and laws protecting institutionalized persons from unconstitutional treatment.   In total, the FY 2010 budget requests an 18 percent increase in funding for the Civil Rights Division over FY 2009. None None   Illegal immigration and border security are paramount concerns for the United States, particularly along the Southwest Border.   The FY 2010 budget addresses the threats and challenges posed by the Southwest Border to the entire criminal justice system.   In recent years, budget increases have been focused on the front end of the pipeline without proportionately increasing the back end of the system, which includes many DOJ responsibilities.   To address this imbalance, the Department proposes an increase of $231.6 million, 632 agents and 110 attorneys for a Southwest Border Enforcement Initiative.        The Departments initiative focuses on combating violence, stopping the flow of illegal weapons and drug trafficking, bringing criminals to justice and sharing critical information, technical assistance and training with our law enforcement partners on both sides of the border.   The initiative brings together the law enforcement and prosecutorial components of the Department, including DEA, ATF, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program, the U.S. Attorneys, the Criminal and Civil Divisions and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, to help secure the border and restore the rule of law to the region.   The budget also includes significant resources for the U.S. Marshals Service to protect and secure federal detainees before, during and after judicial proceedings.     Within this enhancement are additional resources for the following Department components: NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone None NoneNone    The number of individuals appearing in federal court has grown at a rapid pace, as has the number of individuals detained and incarcerated.

The budget expands federal prison capacity by funding the build-out and activation of two new medium security prisons and provides for medical care increases, drug treatment and life skills programs and additional correctional workers. None NoneNone  The Department of Justice continues to seek ways to improve performance and accountability.   The budget request includes a program increase of $14.0 million to continue implementation of the critical Unified Financial Management System, a major initiative that greatly improves the efficiency and integrity of the Departments financial and performance management and accounting functions.None
