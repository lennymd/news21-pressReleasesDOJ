  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced today that it has reached a settlement with the city of Highland Park, Mich., to resolve allegations that the city willfully violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) by failing to properly reemploy firefighter and U.S. Army reservist Paul A. Baetz in July 2009 when he returned from military service in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The Justice Departments complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit, alleges that while Mr. Baetz was overseas in military service, the city of Highland Park promoted three auxiliary firefighters with less seniority than Mr. Baetz to full-time firefighter and refused to properly re-employ Mr. Baetz as a full-time firefighter upon his return. Subject to certain conditions, USERRA requires employers to promptly re-employ returning service members in the positions they would have held had their employment not been interrupted by military service, or in a position of like seniority, status and pay.NoneNone
