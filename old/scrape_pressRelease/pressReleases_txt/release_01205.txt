On Memorial Day, our nation unites in remembrance of the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces who gave their lives to defend our freedoms. We share our prayers and sympathies with their families and loved ones, recognizing with gratitude that when our nation called, these brave heroes answered with their lives.The Attorney General, and personnel throughout the Department of Justice, will observe the National Moment of Remembrance on Memorial Day, May 29, at 3 p.m. The National Moment of Remembrance, which was established by Congress in 2000, encourages all American citizens, including federal agency personnel, to pause for one minute to remember the men and women who lost their lives fighting for our nation and its values of freedom and peace. Every day, the Department of Justice pays tribute to the servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice. Memorial Day provides a special opportunity to reflect on the magnitude of that sacrifice.Those who have fallen in defense of our country have earned an honor that must be recognized by both our words and deeds. Through its Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative, the Department of Justice is working tirelessly to ensure that all members of our military receive the legal and constitutional protections that they have fought so hard  and so valiantly  to help secure. They deserve the best that we have to give, because they have given the best of themselves. This Memorial Day, please join us at the Department of Justice to, as Abraham Lincoln stated at Gettysburg, dedicate ourselves to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.
