U.S. District Judge Thomas M. Durkin for the Northern District of Illinois today sentenced John Dennis Hastert, 74, of Plano, Illinois, to 15 months in federal prison. Hastert pleaded guilty last year to one count of illegally structuring cash withdrawals in order to evade financial reporting requirements.After the sentencing hearing, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois issued the following statement:With this case, the Office sought to hold Mr. Hastert accountable for the crimes he committed that could still be prosecuted: illegally structuring cash withdrawals and lying to the government about his motive for engaging in that activity. All of us have been inspired by the strength and bravery of the victims and witnesses who came forward in the most challenging of circumstances. As in all cases, the Office is dedicated to doing everything we can to help victims and their families seek justice. It is our hope that the sentence imposed today will promote respect for the law.The sentencing was announced by U.S. Attorney Zachary T.
