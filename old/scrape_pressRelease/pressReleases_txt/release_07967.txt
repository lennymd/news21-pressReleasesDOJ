None None The agreement is court-enforceable, and an independent reviewer with decades of experience will monitor the commonwealths compliance with the agreement, meet with the parties and stakeholders, and issue regular reports. The Justice Department and Virginia submitted the agreement for the courts approval on Jan. 26, 2012. On March 6, 2012, the court provisionally approved the agreement and solicited public comment on it. After considering hundreds of submittals from a wide range of stakeholders and conducting a day-long hearing on June 8, 2012, the court determined that the agreement was fair, reasonable, and adequate with limited modifications. The department and the commonwealth then submitted modifications, and on August 23, 2012, the court formally approved the agreement as modified and entered it as a court order. We are pleased that the court, after hearing from thousands of very engaged stakeholders and examining the extensive record, gave final approval to the settlement agreement, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. We commend the commonwealth of Virginia, and particularly the leadership of Governor McDonnell and Secretary Hazel, on the commitment they are already demonstrating to fully implementing the agreement. We also appreciate the deep interest and involvement of stakeholders, including those who have long fought for these changes as well as those who raised concerns. We are committed to ensuring that the agreement is implemented fairly on behalf of all Virginians with intellectual and developmental disabilities. said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil H. MacBride. None
