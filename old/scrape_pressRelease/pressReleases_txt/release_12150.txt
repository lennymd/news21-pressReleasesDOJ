  "The Supreme Courts decision to leave in place Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act marks a victory for voting rights in America. In a nearly-unanimous decision, the Court not only recognized the historic achievements of the Voting Rights Act as helping make us a very different Nation, but also ensured that this law will continue to protect free and fair access to the voting booth. The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously enforce the Voting Rights Act, which was renewed with overwhelmingly bipartisan support in Congress in 2006.  "As a nation, we have made great strides in advancing and protecting civil rights in the past 44 years since the Voting Rights Act was first passed. But there is still more work to be done to fulfill the promise of full voting rights, free from discrimination, for all Americans."
