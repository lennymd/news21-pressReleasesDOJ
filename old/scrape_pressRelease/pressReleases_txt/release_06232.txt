A former Lorain County, Ohio, corrections officer was sentenced today to serve 18 months in prison followed by two years of supervised release after previously pleading guilty to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorney Steven M. Dettelbach for the Northern District of Ohio and Special Agent in Charge Stephen D. Anthony of the FBIs Cleveland Office. Marlon Taylor, 47, of Vermilion, Ohio, was working as a corrections officer in Lorain County Jail on July 29, 2012, when he assaulted an inmate by striking him repeatedly, according to court documents. These actions caused bodily injury to the inmate and deprived the inmate of the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, according to court documents. "Uses of excessive force by corrections officers undermine our system of justice and the rule of law, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuels. Today's sentence reflects that the Department of Justice will aggressively protect the constitutional rights of every American." The vast majority of law enforcement officials do a great job, said U.S. Attorney Dettelbach. When someone abuses the power and privileges of their office, however, they can and will be held accountable. Marlon Taylor is not representative of the vast majority of the honorable men and women serving within the criminal justice system, said Special Agent in Charge Anthony. Any allegation of abuse or excessive force involving law enforcement officers takes on a particular sense of urgency and will continue to be a priority for the FBI. This investigation has been conducted by the FBIs Cleveland Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antoinette T. Bacon and Lauren Bell and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl prosecuted the case.
