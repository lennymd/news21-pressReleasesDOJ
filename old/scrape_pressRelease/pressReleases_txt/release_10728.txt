      WASHINGTON      The Justice Department today announced that it has reached an agreement with Wisconsin officials to help ensure that military service members and U.S. citizens living overseas have an opportunity to participate fully in the Nov. 2, 2010, federal general election.   None      Under the agreement, Wisconsin will provide a 49-day window for military and overseas voters to receive, mark and submit their ballots to ensure sufficient time to have their ballots counted. To accomplish this, the agreement requires Wisconsin to both accelerate the date by which they will send ballots out to military and overseas voters to Oct. 1, 2010, and to add additional time -- until Nov. 19, 2010 -- for receipt of their absentee ballots. Absent the agreement, military and overseas voters would have had much less time to receive and return their ballots. None      The department is fully committed to vigorously enforcing the MOVE Act, which is designed to remove barriers and give members of the uniformed services, their families and our citizens living overseas the opportunity for full participation in the elections of our nations leaders, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.  I am extremely pleased that Wisconsins officials have worked cooperatively with the department and have agreed to measures that will afford immediate relief to ensure that the states military and overseas voters, many of whom are members of our armed forces and their families bravely serving our country around the world, will have the opportunity to have their votes counted in the upcoming election.         The agreement, which still must be approved by the federal district court in Madison, Wis., resolved the departments claims regarding compliance with UOCAVA in the Nov. 2, 2010, election.  The agreement also commits the state to take steps to ensure compliance with UOCAVA in future federal elections and provide a report to the Department of Justice on those efforts.  None       Wisconsin sought a hardship waiver on grounds that its Sept. 14, 2010,  primary date prohibited it from complying with the 45-day deadline specified by the MOVE Act.  On Aug. 27, 2010, the Department of Defense denied Wisconsins request for a waiver, finding that under the MOVE Act although the state had shown an undue hardship for the Nov. 2, 2010, election, its proposed comprehensive plan did not afford sufficient time for UOCAVA voters to receive and submit absentee ballots in time to have them counted.  Immediately following denial of the waiver application, the Department of Justice advised Wisconsin officials that the department had authorized litigation to enforce UOCAVA.  Discussions with the state were initiated to resolve the matter, which led to the agreement filed today.   None
