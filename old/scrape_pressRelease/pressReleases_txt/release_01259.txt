Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the attached memorandum establishing charging and sentencing policies for the Department of Justice.  This policy was formulated after extensive consultation with Assistant U.S. Attorneys at both the trial and appellate level, as well as U.S. Attorneys and Main Justice Attorneys. It ensures that the Department enforces the law fairly and consistently, advances public safety and promotes respect for our legal system. Attorney General Sessions will issue further remarks on the new policy later this morning. None
