Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "We are glad that, at the height of tax season, HRB has affirmed its commitment to provide effective communication of its tax preparation services and classes for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing,"The agreement requires that HRB:The ADA prohibits discrimination against customers with disabilities by businesses that serve the public. Among other things, the ADA requires tax preparation services, accountants, lawyers, doctors and other businesses to provide equal access to customers who are deaf or hard of hearing. When services such as tax preparation involve important, lengthy, or complex oral communications with customers, businesses are generally required to provide qualified sign language interpreters and other auxiliary aids, free of charge, to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Other auxiliary aids may include the use of relay services for telephone communication, exchanging notes for brief and uncomplicated communications, and providing assistive listening systems and receivers in classes for attendees who are hard of hearing. The appropriate auxiliary aid to be provided depends on a variety of factors including the nature, length and importance of the communication; the communication skills and knowledge of the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing; and the individuals stated need for a particular type of auxiliary aid.None
