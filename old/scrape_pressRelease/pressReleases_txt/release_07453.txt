    Mary and Christian Young and Octavious Reeves were indicted by a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Alabama on a variety of charges stemming from an identity theft and tax fraud conspiracy, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. The alleged conspirators were charged in a 31-count indictment that was returned on Dec. 18, 2012, and unsealed today.       Mary and Christian Young and Octavious Reeves, all of Elmore County, Ala., were charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, along with access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.  Mary Young was also charged with several counts of wire fraud. According to the indictment, the defendants conspiracy lasted from January 2012 through June 2012 and involved using stolen identities to file tax returns claiming fraudulent refunds.       The indictment further alleges that Mary Young obtained the names and Social Security numbers of individuals that were then used to electronically file false tax returns. Mary Young would direct the false tax refunds to bank accounts linked to prepaid debit cards. Mary and Christian Young and Octavious Reeves would then use the prepaid debit cards to withdraw cash or pay for personal items.     An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Mary Young faces face a maximum potential sentence of 328 years in prison, Christian Young faces a maximum of 27 years in prison, and Octavious Reeves faces a maximum of 78 years in prison.     IRS-Criminal Investigation agents investigated this case, and Justice Department Tax Division trial attorneys Charles M. Edgar Jr. and Michael Boteler are prosecuting the case.
