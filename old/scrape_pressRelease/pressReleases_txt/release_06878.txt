NoneNone   Lorraine Brown will spend five years in prison for her central role in a scheme to fraudulently execute thousands of mortgage-related documents while our nations housing market was at its most vulnerable point in generations, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman. The documents that were fraudulently produced under Browns direction were relied upon in court proceedings, including a significant number of foreclosure and bankruptcy matters. Todays sentencing represents appropriate punishment for someone who sought to capitalize on the nations housing crisis.   Floridians were hard hit by the downturn in the real estate market, said U.S. Attorney ONeill. We will continue to pursue individuals like Brown who took advantage of consumers for personal gain and contributed to the financial crisis. Prosecuting financial crimes remains a priority for our office. NoneNoneNoneNone   After these documents were falsely signed and fraudulently notarized, Brown authorized DocX employees to file and record them with local county property records offices across the country.   Many of these documents were later relied upon in court proceedings, including property foreclosures and federal bankruptcy actions.   Brown admitted she understood that property recorders, courts, title insurers and homeowners relied upon the documents as genuine.   This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Ryan Rohlfsen and Assistant Chief Glenn S. Leon of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark B. Devereaux of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida.   This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the state of Floridas Department of Financial Services.    None
