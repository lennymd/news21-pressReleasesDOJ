  Attorney General Eric Holder met with Mexican Attorney General Jess Murillo Karam today to discuss the release by the Mexican government of Rafael Caro Quintero, who was convicted of murdering Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena in February 1985.None  I appreciated the chance to discuss the recent developments in the case connected to the murder of DEA special agent Kiki Camarena and other important matters with Attorney General Murillo this afternoon. I look forward to working with him to continue to advance our shared commitment to the rule of law. Nothing will weaken our resolve to hold accountable those who commit acts of violence against our brave law enforcement agents, said Attorney General Holder. The kidnapping and murder of Agent Camarena was a heinous crime that shocked criminal justice professionals on both sides of the border. Like many, I was surprised and deeply concerned to learn about the release of Rafael Caro Quintero last month. We will continue to work with our Mexican counterparts to ensure that Caro Quintero does not escape justice.  In May 1987, the Department of Justice, through the United States Attorneys Office in the Central District of California, indicted Caro Quintero and several others, for conspiracy and racketeering charges related to the kidnapping, torture and murder in Mexico of Agent Camarena. Since then, the Department of Justice has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in ensuring that Caro Quintero faces justice.
