  WASHINGTON    A federal district court in Connecticut has permanently barred Elda Sinani, a resident of that state, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Sinani consented to the civil injunction order.  According to the government complaint, Sinani operated two businesses    Eagle Notary Public & Tax Service in Waterbury, Conn., from November 2001 through April 2004 and later Universe Travel & Legal Services in Hartford, Conn. The complaint alleges that she provided tax return preparation services through both of these businesses. The complaint further alleges that Sinani inflated deductions for her customers to which they otherwise were not entitled. An example identified in the complaint asserts that she frequently improperly reported her customers transfer of monies to family members as charitable contributions.  The complaint states that Sinani prepared more than 1,500 returns for the tax years 2003 through 2006. According to the complaint, the IRS has determined that the U.S. Treasury has incurred more than $300,000 in losses from tax returns prepared by Sinani and may have incurred losses exceeding $2.9 million.None
