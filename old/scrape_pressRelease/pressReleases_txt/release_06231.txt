None       According to the indictment and evidence produced at trial, Ross won a monetary award of approximately $840,000 in 1999 after arbitration of an employment dispute with a former employer. Ross then proceeded to file a false mortgage on his residence, file a false lien on his vehicle, deal extensively in cash and direct funds to an offshore account in order to evade paying the full amount he owed in income tax for 1999. In addition, from 2004 through 2007, Ross earned commission income for referring clients to what appeared to be an investment company based in Nevis and evaded his taxes by using nominees and other means.       The case was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation and was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Kevin Lombardi and Kimberly Shartar of the Tax Division. None
