    Anthony Williams, of Baton Rouge, La., was sentenced to serve 24 months in prison followed by two years of supervised release, the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) announced today. Williams previously pleaded guilty to threatening to retaliate against a witness by causing bodily injury. None     Our legal system depends on witnesses testifying without the fear of retribution, said Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally for the Tax Division. This prosecution shows that the Justice Department will take action when someone threatens a witness.     Threatening or intimidating a witness in a federal criminal matter is a quick way to find yourself in federal prison, said U.S. Attorney J. Walter Green for the Middle District of Louisiana. Our office will continue to have zero tolerance for such conduct and will continue to devote the necessary resources to aggressively pursue those who engage in such conduct. No one should fear speaking the truth about possible federal criminal activity.       It is extremely important for witnesses who provide testimony in criminal matters to know that our justice system protects them from retaliation, said Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation Gabriel L. Grehan. It is also appropriate for Anthony Williams to suffer the consequences of his actions to threaten a witness in a criminal proceeding. IRS-CIwould like to thank the Department of Justice and our federal law enforcement partners for pursuing this case to its foreseeable end.     Assistant Attorney General Keneally and U.S. Attorney Green commended the efforts of special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation and TIGTA, who investigated the case, and of Tax Division Trial Attorney Jason Poole and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Stevens, who prosecuted the case.
