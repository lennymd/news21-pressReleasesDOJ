NoneAssociate Attorney General Tom Perrelli announced the CTAS awards today at the National Museum of the American Indian. Perrelli noted that Attorney General Holder and other Department of Justice leadership held tribal listening sessions last year. The department developed CTAS in response to views shared at these sessions, Tribal consultation events and other feedback from tribal leaders.Today, we take another major step toward true nation-to-nation collaboration, said Perrelli. CTAS is not only a more streamlined grant-making process, it is part of the departments broader strategy of increased engagement with tribal communities across a broad range of areas.CTAS includes most of the tribal programs from the departments Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). The programs were listed as 10 purpose areas. In previous years, tribes seeking funding for more than one of these purposes would need to submit multiple grant applications. With CTAS, tribes were able to submit a single application while selecting multiple purpose areas, ranging from juvenile justice to violence against women.This approach not only saves time and resources, but it also allows tribes and the Department to gain a better understanding of overall public safety needs, Perrelli added. Through CTAS and other initiatives, we have sought to take action to respond to tribal leaders and help end the inexcusably high crime rates in tribal communities. None All federally recognized tribes were eligible for CTAS. OJP, COPS and OVW worked together in making the award decisions. Tribal leaders have been invited to a tribal consultation session on October 5, 2010 in Spokane to discuss ways to improve the Departments grant-making process in future years. None
