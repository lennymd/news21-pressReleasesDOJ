A federal court in Montgomery, Alabama, has permanently barred a Montgomery tax preparer from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The complaint alleged that Jenika Williams prepared returns that falsely claimed or inflated taxpayers income tax refunds by using social security numbers and other identifying information of third parties to falsely claim dependents in order to overstate the taxpayers claim to the Earned Income Tax Credit.Williams, the suit alleges, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Altogether, the loss to the U.S. Treasury from Williams activities may exceed $1 million. The permanent injunction was entered by U.S. District Judge W. Keith Watkins for the Middle District of Alabama after Williams failed to respond to the lawsuit.NoneRelated Materials:None
