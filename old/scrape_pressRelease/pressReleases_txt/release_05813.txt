    The Justice Department announced today that it will monitor elections on May 13, 2014, in Colfax and Douglas Counties, Nebraska, to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act and other federal voting rights statutes.

In Colfax County, the department will assign federal observers from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to monitor polling place activities based on a court order. The observers will watch and record activities during voting hours at polling locations in this jurisdiction, and Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate the federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.     In addition, department personnel will monitor polling place activities in Douglas County. A   Civil Rights Division attorney will coordinate federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.     Each year, the department deploys federal observers from OPM and departmental staff to monitor elections across the country. To file complaints about discriminatory voting practices, including acts of harassment or intimidation, voters may call the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-253-3931. None
