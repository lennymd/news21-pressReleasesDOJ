The graffiti and markings included the German words "Juden Raus" ("Jews Out"), and the statement "Hitler was right.""Threats against religious institutions and their members will not be tolerated in this country," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.

Brown, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.The case was investigated by special agents from the Mobile Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the City of Mobile Police Department.
