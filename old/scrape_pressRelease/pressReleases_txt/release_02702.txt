Return Preparer Allegedly Claimed Fraudulent Credits and DeductionsA federal court has ordered West Palm Beach-area tax return preparer Paul Jean not to prepare federal tax returns for anyone except himself, the Justice Department announced today. The order was entered after Jean failed to respond to the United States civil complaint.According to the complaint, Jean has operated under the business names Whiz Tax and Rejoice Tax Services. The complaint alleges he has prepared returns that claim fabricated or inflated tax credits including claiming improper earned income tax credits, education credits, or fuel credits. In addition, Jean allegedly prepared returns that report false or inflated deductions on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), such as deductions for mortgage interest paid or charitable contributions, or on Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business), such as expenditures for supplies or office expenses.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that Jean, directly or indirectly, has prepared and filed more than 3,000 tax returns since 2012, according to the complaint, and that the harm Jeans conduct has inflicted on the U.S. Treasury may be in the millions of dollars.None
