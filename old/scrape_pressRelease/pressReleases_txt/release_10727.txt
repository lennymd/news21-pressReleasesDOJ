  WASHINGTON  "Todays report showing violent crime declined in 2009 is an encouraging sign that our nation continues to make progress in the fight against crime. Although there are many reasons behind the decline, one thing is certain: smarter policing practices and investments in law enforcement play a significant role in reducing violent and property crime.  "In 2009, the Obama administration provided over four billion dollars in support to law enforcement and criminal justice initiatives through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, including one billion in COPS funding to keep police officers on the street. We also provided an additional $519 million in Byrne Justice Assistance Grants to support our state and local criminal justice partners. These investments have helped maintain public safety and encourage new criminal justice innovations in state and local jurisdictions across the country and have now funded over 16,000 jobs, many of which would have been lost without passage of the Recovery Act.  "The decrease in violent crime has a real impact on the lives of millions of Americans, but we have much more to do. We will continue to support our state and local partners and to implement the tough, smart policing policies that we know make a difference in the fight against crime."
