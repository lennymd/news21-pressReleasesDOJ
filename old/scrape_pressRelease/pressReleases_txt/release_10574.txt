  WASHINGTON  In response to a motion by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. District Court in New Orleans has ordered the establishment of a security zone extending 750 feet in all directions from the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon wreckage site and its debris field. The security zone extends from the center of the wreckage site, which is located at the precise coordinates N28-5491/W088-22.0293 (in the area known as the Mississippi Canyon 252) from the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico to the sea surface.  The court found it in the interest of the public to protect the search area and any evidence located in the area against intentional or unintentional loss, the order said. It ordered the United States to inform the public and advise all known parties capable of intruding into the security zone.  In accordance with the order, the Department of Justice has informed those companies known to have the means and equipment to do so not to enter the security zone.  The order will be enforced by the United States using the full range of security assets available, including vessels, aircraft or other appropriate means and equipment.  The security zone will remain in place until Oct. 8, 2011 unless renewed for good cause, the court ordered.
