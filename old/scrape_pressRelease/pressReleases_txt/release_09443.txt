      WASHINGTON - Scott Robertson pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells in Salt Lake City to one count of making and subscribing a false tax return for 2003, the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.         According to the plea agreement, beginning in at least 2000 and continuing until at least 2007, Scott Robertson was the chief executive officer and co-owner of Infinia Healthcare LLC, which owned several long-term care facilities in Utah, Arizona, Kansas and Minnesota.  During this same time period, Robertson had ownership interest in a number of other entities affiliated with Infinia Healthcare, including Robertson Properties-Two and Maryland Capital LLC.         According to the plea agreement, between 2003 and 2005, Robertson earned substantial income from Infinia Healthcare through unofficial, non-salary payments.  Robertson filtered some of these payments through Maryland Capital LLC to his personal bank accounts and failed to accurately report this additional income to the IRS.  He further admitted that he filed a false U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040, for tax year 2003 with the IRS, knowing that the return substantially understated the total income he earned from Infinia Healthcare and its affiliates and substantially understated the tax due and owing for 2003.  According to the plea agreement, Robertson agreed that the tax loss is more than $200,000 but less than $400,000.       Robertson faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of $250,000.         This case was investigated by the IRS-Criminal Investigation in Salt Lake City and is being prosecuted by Justice Department Tax Division Trial Attorneys Monica B. Edelstein and Kimberly M. Shartar.
