None  As this agreement demonstrates, we will remain steadfast in our efforts to ensure that members of our armed forces, their families and overseas citizens are offered a full and meaningful opportunity to vote in our nations elections, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. I commend the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board and its executive director for working cooperatively with the department and agreeing to measures that will ensure Wisconsins military and overseas voters will have a full opportunity to have their votes counted in the upcoming presidential primary election as well as in future federal elections.  Servicemembers make tremendous sacrifices for our nation, said John W. Vaudreuil, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin. We are committed to seeing that Wisconsin meets its obligations to ensure that military voters, as well as U.S. citizens who are overseas, are given the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.None
