Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement regarding the Presidents nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court:I commend President Obama on his nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland as an associate justice on the Supreme Court. In all of his prior work  from his time at the Department of Justice, where he prosecuted terrorists like Ted Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh, to his 19-year service on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  Judge Garland has earned a reputation for fairness and the respect of colleagues across the ideological spectrum. His impeccable credentials, steadfast fidelity to the law and firm devotion to the public interest make him an outstanding choice to sit on our nation's highest court, where I am certain he will serve with integrity and wisdom. I strongly support the President's choice and I urge Congress to approve Judge Garlands nomination and fill this important position without delay.
