  WASHINGTON - A federal district court in Tennessee has permanently barred Chattanooga resident Demita Brown-Watkins from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Brown-Watkins agreed to the civil injunction order.  According to the government complaint, Brown-Watkins ran her tax-preparation business through two companies  Fastax and Rapid Tax Service  and advertised the "largest refund in town." The government complaint alleged that Brown-Watkins listed fictitious expenses (such as gifts to charity) on her customers Schedules A; selected the incorrect filing status or listed ineligible dependants on her customers returns; filed claims for education credits for customers who she knew were ineligible for them; and listed fictitious Schedule C businesses on the tax returns of customers who were ineligible to file a Schedule C.  The complaint further asserts that Brown-Watkins prepared more than 3,000 returns since 2004 and that, based on IRS estimates, Brown-Watkins deprived the U.S. Treasury of over $8 million in tax revenue.None
