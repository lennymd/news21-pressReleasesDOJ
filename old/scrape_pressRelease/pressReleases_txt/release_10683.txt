NoneNone       Stevan Nathan Ringo, 26, of Marrero, La., pleaded guilty today before Judge T.S. Ellis, III in U.S. District Court in Virginia to one count of bribery.  Ringo was originally charged in an indictment filed on Aug. 24, 2010.  Ringos sentencing is set for Jan. 7, 2011.        According to court documents, Ringo was stationed at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Shank, a U.S. Army installation in the Logar Province of Eastern Afghanistan.  FOB Shank supports U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in various ways, including through fuel receipt and redistribution.  More specifically, the Army stores large quantities of fuel at FOB Shank and redistributes that fuel to installations in the surrounding area through government contractors.  Ringos responsibilities at FOB Shank included supervision of that fuel redistribution process.       In his guilty plea, Ringo admitted that between December 2009 and February 2010, he accepted more than $400,000 in cash payments from a government contractor in exchange for creating and submitting fraudulent paperwork permitting that contractor to steal fuel from FOB Shank.  The total value of the fuel stolen in the course of the scheme was nearly $1.5 million.        At sentencing, Ringo faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a fine of the greater of $250,000; three times the value of the payments made or solicited; or twice the value gained or lost from the scheme.
