Today, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced several steps by the Department of Justice to enable the nationwide collection of data on law enforcement interactions with civilians, including data related to the use of force by law enforcement officers.Accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations, said Attorney General Lynch. The initiatives we are announcing today are vital efforts toward increasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve. In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.NoneThe Attorney General announced additional details regarding these efforts:These initiatives demonstrate once again the departments deep commitment to the ideals of the Presidents Task Force. The department will continue to work with local, state, tribal and federal agencies to encourage and support data collection and transparency beyond these projects.
