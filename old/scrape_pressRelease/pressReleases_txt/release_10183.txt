  WASHINGTON  The former president of Infinia Healthcare LLC, a company that operated long-term healthcare facilities in several states, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court in Utah for three counts of tax evasion, the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.  According to the indictment, Jon Robertson, of Bountiful, Utah, attempted to evade taxes he owed in 2003 through 2005 by filing false tax returns, causing money to be transferred to bank accounts he controlled, and by directing others to make false record entries.  An indictment merely allege that crimes have been committed, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Jon Robertson faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.  The case is being prosecuted by Tax Division trial attorneys Monica B. Edelstein and Kimberly M. Shartar, and is being investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation in Salt Lake City.None
