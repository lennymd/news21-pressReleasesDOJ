WASHINGTON  Bureau of Prisons employee Jack Chris Jackson, 45, pleaded guilty today to the charge of sexual abuse of a ward, announced the Department of Justice. During the plea proceedings, Jackson admitted to having a sexual relationship with an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institute (FCI) in Miami. This inmate was in Jacksons custodial and supervisory authority at FCI. We will not tolerate corrections officers engaging in this behavior with institutionalized persons, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute individuals who abuse their position and authority in this manner. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A. Ferrer added, This correction officer abused his official position. This conduct is an intolerable breach of trust that not only endangers the safety of inmates but also compromises prison security. Our office will prosecute all official corruption cases to the fullest extent of the law. Jackson faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Sentencing has been set for March 19, 2012. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Rhee Osborne of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Henry Leventis of the Civil Rights Division.
