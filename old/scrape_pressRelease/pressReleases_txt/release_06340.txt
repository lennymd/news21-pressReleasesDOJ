  The Justice Department announced today that Northrop Grumman Corp. has paid the United States $11.4 million to settle a government claim for penalties provided under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and False Claims Act allegations stemming from its failure to abide by a 2002 settlement agreement with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). The government alleged that Northrop charged to its federal contracts certain costs for deferred compensation awards to key employees, even though it had promised not to do so as part of the earlier 2002 settlement.None  The settlement was the result of a consolidated effort spearheaded by the Civil Divisions Commercial Litigation Branch in conjunction with the DCMA and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, Western Region Investigative Support Division. The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. The case is captioned Northrop Grumman Corporation v. United States, Fed. Cl. No. 07-482C.
