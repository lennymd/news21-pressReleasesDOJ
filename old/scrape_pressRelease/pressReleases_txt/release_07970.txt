None   The consent decree, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of North Carolina, requires Burke County to modify its policy designed to prevent harassment and discrimination in the workplace and provide annual training to Burke County supervisors and employees about discrimination and harassment. The lawsuit was filed with the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys office for the Western District of North Carolina.   Federal law requires employers to maintain a workplace free of racial harassment, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. I commend Burke County for working with the Justice Department to put effective policies and training in place to prevent workplace discrimination and harassment.   The complaint alleges that while investigating a claim of racial discrimination involving the use of a racial epithet by a Burke County supervisor in the presence of subordinates, the division learned that Burke County supervisors and employees had received no training on race harassment and discrimination, and as such, the supervisor claimed to be unaware of potential consequences for use of a racial epithet that was offensive to her employees.   Racial harassment and discrimination should not be tolerated anywhere, particularly in the workplace, said Anne M. Tompkins, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The U.S. Attorneys office is committed to protecting employees from working in hostile work environments, and will continue to enforce Title VII. NoneNone
