NoneJudge Robert L. Wilkinsof the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia signed the civil injunction order, to which Michael Strauss agreed without admitting the governments allegations. The order permanently bars Strauss from promoting the cemetery schemes identified in the complaint or any other tax shelter, from marketing business or tax services that facilitate noncompliance with federal tax laws, and from engaging in any fraudulent conduct subject to penalty under the tax laws. The same court previously entered injunction orders against Barreiro and Patrick Strauss, to which they consented without admitting the allegations against them.The defendants allegedly falsely told their customers that they had purchased licenses worth tens of millions of dollars that purportedly gave the shell companies the right to future profits from performing funeral services at two purported cemeteries located in Virginia and New York. According to the complaint, the men also falsely claimed that those companies could deduct a portion of the licenses supposed value and then pass on millions of dollars in tax losses to the customers. The government contends that there were no arms-length purchases of licenses and that the license values were fabricated to generate fake tax benefits. The defendants also allegedly used fictitious promissory notes to siphon off, for their personal benefit, millions of dollars that they told their customers were being invested.NoneRelated Documents:United States v.
