The Justice Department announced today that it has asked a federal court in Indianapolis, to bar Cynthia Hawk, who operates Gain Tax Services, from preparing tax returns. The civil injunction suit alleges that Hawk fails to comply with due diligence requirements imposed by federal law on tax preparers who claim the earned income tax credit (EITC) on customers income tax returns. According to the complaint, Hawk also falsified customers incomes in order to claim the maximum EITC for them.The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit available to certain low to moderate income working individuals and families. As a refundable credit, the EITC may entitle a taxpayer to a refund from the U.S. Treasury. The amount of the EITC depends on the taxpayers income, filing status and claimed number of dependents. The maximum credit in 2010 was $5,666. The range of earned income generating a maximum EITC is sometimes called the sweet spot. According to the complaint, Hawk fabricated businesses and reported fake business income on her customers tax returns to reach the EITC sweet spot.NoneRelated Materials:None
