  WASHINGTONThe Department of Justice released the following statement Tuesday  from spokesperson Emily Pierce regarding the ruling in the case of King v.  Burwell by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the ruling by the D.C.  Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Halbig v. Burwell:  Today, the Fourth Circuit unanimously ruled in support of Congressional  intent and common sense: that an American may receive tax credits to make health  care more affordable regardless of whether they are participating in a state-run  or a federally-facilitated marketplace. While two appeals judges ruled  differently, four appeals judges have now cast their votes with two lower  courts, Congress, and the Affordable Care Act. In the meantime, to be clear,  people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed, tax  credits remain available.
