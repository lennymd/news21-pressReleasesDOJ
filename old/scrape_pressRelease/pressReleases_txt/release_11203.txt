  WASHINGTON-- The United States has filed suit asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to permanently bar Saloum A. Njie and his company, MIAAS Associates LLC, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  According to the governments complaint, since at least 2004, the defendants have prepared tax returns containing material misrepresentations of fact, which defendants knew or should have known were false. The government alleges that the defendants prepare customers tax returns that either claim the earned income tax credit for customers who do not qualify for the credit, or overstate the credit amount to which customers are entitled.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that defendants have continued this unlawful practice despite three separate investigations by the Internal Revenue Service, each of which found numerous violations of federal tax law and resulted in thousands of dollars in monetary penalties.  The complaint alleges that defendants tax preparation scheme resulted in more than $1 million in understated federal income tax liabilities for their customers, for returns prepared between 2006 and 2009.  Since 2001, the Justice Departments Tax Division has obtained more than 465 injunctions to stop the promotion of tax fraud schemes and the preparation of fraudulent returns. Information about these cases is available on the Justice Department Web site.
