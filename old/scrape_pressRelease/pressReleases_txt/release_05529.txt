  The Department of Justice announced today that it will require Landmark Aviation  to divest fixed base operator assets (FBOs) used to provide flight support  services to general aviation customers at Scottsdale Municipal Airport, in  Arizona, in order to proceed with its $330 million acquisition of Ross Aviation.    The department said that without the  required divestiture, the transaction would have combined the only two FBOs  serving general aviation customers at Scottsdale Municipal Airport, resulting in  higher prices and lower quality of services.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone  As required by the Tunney  Act, the proposed settlement, along with the departments competitive impact  statement, will be published in the Federal Register.
