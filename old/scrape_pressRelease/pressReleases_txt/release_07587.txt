Attorney General Eric Holders Task Force on Children Exposed to Violence today presented its final report and policy recommendations gathered from public hearings held across the country over the past year. The task force report includes 56 recommendations and highlights the importance of identifying children who are victims or witnesses of violence and providing support and services to help them heal. It focuses on developing programs to help children access supportive and non-violent relationships with trusted adults in their homes and communities. The task force also calls for all children who enter the juvenile justice system to be screened for exposure to violence. I want to thank the task force for their diligent work on this important effort. This report will be carefully considered and used as the basis for action  and as a blueprint for strengthening our robust efforts to protect young people from exposure to violence, said Attorney General Holder. The findings of this task force will ensure that policymakers, criminal justice professionals, social service providers, and members of the public continue to regard preventing and remedying children's exposure to violence as far more than a professional obligation  but as a moral calling.As a key part of Attorney General Holders Defending Childhood initiative to address childrens exposure to violence, the task force is comprised of 13 leading experts, including practitioners, child and family advocates, academicians and licensed clinicians .
