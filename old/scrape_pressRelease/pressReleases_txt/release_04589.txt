Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney James L. Santelle of the Eastern District of Wisconsin announced today that Kyle Allen Smith, 21, of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, has entered a guilty plea to possession of ricin. At sentencing, Smith faces a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and fine of $250,000.According to the plea agreement, Smith admitted growing castor bean plants and extracting ricin from the beans. A substance found in Smiths residence was sent to the Department of Homeland Securitys National Bioforensics Analysis Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and tested positive for the toxin ricin. Ricin is a toxin that infects human cells and blocks their ability to synthesize their own protein. Small doses of ricin may be lethal to human beings if ingested, inhaled or injected. Symptoms of ricin poisoning can include difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, with possible death occurring within 36 to 72 hours. According to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are no known antidotes for ricin poisoning.Smith admitted having homicidal thoughts and that his homicidal thoughts might have sparked his curiosity about the production of ricin. He stated he would not use or test the ricin on any human because too many people knew what he was doing and would turn him in.Smith was arrested on Oct. 31, 2014, after two professors at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh reported to campus authorities that Smith was making unusual inquiries about chemical processes, including extracting ribosomal inhibiting proteins. Assistant Attorney General Carlin joins U.S. Attorney Santelle in praising the actions of the professors and the university administration in bringing Smith to the prompt attention of law enforcement authorities. Assistant Attorney General Carlin is also very grateful to the Wisconsin National Guard, 54th Civil Support Team, for the critical assistance they provided in the safe recovery of the ricin.The case was investigated by the Oshkosh Police Department and the FBI. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul L. Kanter of the Eastern District of Wisconsin and the Justice Departments National Security Division.
