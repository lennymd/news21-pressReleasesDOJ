The Justice Department issued a letter of findings today concluding that the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) policies and practices for housing and employing inmates with disabilities violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Following a comprehensive ADA compliance review, the department found that NDOCs discriminatory practices have resulted in the illegal segregation and stigmatization of inmates with HIV and the incarceration of inmates with disabilities for longer periods, in more restrictive settings, than inmates without disabilities.The departments letter makes three principal findings. First, NDOC segregates inmates with HIV through a policy prohibiting the housing of inmates with HIV in the same cells as inmates who do not have HIV. Second, NDOC denies inmates with HIV equal employment opportunities. Third, NDOC denies inmates with various disabilities, including those with mobility disabilities, HIV or certain other medical or mental health conditions, equal opportunities to benefit from the programs offered at two of NDOCs lowest-custody facilities its conservation camps and transitional-housing facilities.The department found that these discriminatory practices have the following effects:The ADAs promises of non-discriminatory treatment and equal opportunity apply to all people with disabilities, including inmates at correctional facilities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. No inmate should have to stay in segregated housing because of a HIV diagnosis or serve a longer sentence because of a disability. Real and lasting reform in Nevada will require not only systemic changes to its policies, practices and procedures, but also a commitment to address unfounded stereotypes, fears and assumptions about individuals with disabilities.The department commends Nevada for its cooperation with this ADA compliance review and will continue to work closely with NDOC and Nevadas Office of the Attorney General to resolve the departments findings expeditiously and under mutually-agreeable terms.NoneNevada Department of Corrections
