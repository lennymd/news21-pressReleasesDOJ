  A federal court in Atlanta has permanently barred Derrick Jackson and his businesses from preparing federal tax returns for others. The court said that since 2002, Jackson "has prepared blatantly fraudulent tax returns for customers." Jacksons businesses were called Tax Wisdom and International Tax and Accounting Services.  The court said that Jackson used an alias and false federal tax identification number to disguise his true identity from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) when preparing returns. The court also found that Jackson engaged in other unlawful conduct, such as filing phony W-2 forms and claiming false deductions and credits on customers tax returns, including fraudulent fuel tax credits and false earned income tax credits.None  John DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked Grayson Hoffman, the Justice Department trial attorney who handled the case, and Shauna Henline, a technical advisor with the IRSs Small Business/Self-Employed Division, who conducted the investigation.None
