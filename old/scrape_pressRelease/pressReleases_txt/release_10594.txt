NoneNone       According to the superseding indictment, CFE is responsible for supplying electricity in Mexico, and contracts with Mexican and foreign companies for goods and services to help supply electricity services to its customers.  Enrique and Angela Aguilar were directors of Grupo Internacional de Asesores S.A. (Grupo), which purported to provide sales representation services for companies doing business with CFE.       According to the superseding indictment, Lindsey Manufacturing hired Grupo to serve as its sales representative in Mexico and to obtain contracts for it from CFE.  Lindsey Manufacturing makes emergency restoration systems and other equipment used by electrical utility companies.  According to the superseding indictment, many of Lindsey Manufacturings clients were foreign, state-owned utilities, including CFE, which was one of the companys most significant customers.  Grupo received a percentage of the revenue Lindsey Manufacturing realized from its contracts with CFE.         From approximately February 2002 until March 2009, Lindsey Manufacturing, Lindsey, Lee and Enrique Aguilar allegedly orchestrated a scheme in which Enrique Aguilar was paid a 30 percent commission on all the goods and services Lindsey Manufacturing sold to CFE, even though this was a significantly higher commission than previous sales representatives for the company had received.  The superseding indictment alleges that Lindsey and Lee understood that all or part of the 30 percent commission would be used to pay bribes to Mexican officials in exchange for CFE awarding contracts to Lindsey Manufacturing Company.  The costs of goods and services sold to CFE allegedly were increased by 30 percent to ensure that the added cost of paying Enrique Aguilar was absorbed by CFE and not Lindsey Manufacturing.       Enrique Aguilar allegedly caused fraudulent invoices to be submitted from Grupo to Lindsey Manufacturing for 30 percent of the contract price.  According to the superseding indictment, Lindsey and Lee then caused the money requested in the fraudulent invoices to be wired into Grupos brokerage account, allegedly knowing that the invoices were fraudulent and the funds were being used as bribes.
