A federal court has permanently barred Nafeesah H. Hines and Rodney N. Chestnut from promoting an alleged tax fraud scheme, as well as preparing tax returns for anyone other than themselves, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction orders, to which Hines and Chestnut consented without admitting the allegations against them, were entered by Judge Kiyo Matsumoto of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.NoneChestnut, the government alleges, is a former captain with the New York City Corrections Department and promoted the scheme to former co-workers. Hines, who the complaint alleges is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration employee, prepared or filed false 1099 forms with the IRS, both for Chestnuts customers as well as for other people, according to the lawsuit. The complaint alleges that Hines prepared or filed more than 3,000 fraudulent IRS forms that falsely reported over $54 million of purportedly withheld income taxes. NoneRelated Materials:None
