The United States has asked a federal court in Sacramento, California, to bar a Ripon, California, man from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.According to the governments complaint, Sarad Chand has repeatedly prepared federal tax returns that understate his customers federal tax liabilities.The complaint alleges that Chand, and others working with him under the business name S. Chand Tax & Accounting Services, prepared tax returns that falsely claimed inflated or fabricated tax credits or deductions. The suit notes that Chand most frequently prepared returns that falsely inflated unreimbursed employee business expenses. Chand also created Schedule Cs (Profit or Loss From Business) with false income, while for other clients he created false losses or inflated expenses, according to the suit. According to the complaint, these fabrications served to improperly reduce the customers taxable income and resulted in reduced tax liability or inappropriate tax refunds. Moreover, according to the complaint, Chand also led his customers to believe that he was a former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee, when he was not.NoneThe suit alleges that the IRS has completed examinations of 919 of the approximately 8155 tax returns Chand prepared from 2008 to 2012, and that nearly all of the examined returns resulted in a finding of deficiency or denial of a refund claim. The total tax understatement from the 886 returns found to be inaccurate totaled more than $2.7 million.None
