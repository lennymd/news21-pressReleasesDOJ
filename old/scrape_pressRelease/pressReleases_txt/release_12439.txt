  WASHINGTON - The Justice Department announced today that it is making grant funding available for public education programs concerning immigration-related employment discrimination.  The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC), a section of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, announced the availability of funds for public education programs regarding employees rights and employers obligations under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The program is open to public service organizations and others providing information services to employers and/or potential victims of immigration-related employment discrimination. Last year, grants ranging from $40,000 to $100,000 were awarded to 11 organizations serving communities throughout the country.  The INA prohibits discrimination against U.S. citizens and work authorized non-citizens on the basis of citizenship status or national origin in hiring, firing and recruiting or referring for a fee. In addition, the provision prohibits discriminatory over-documentation of workers in the employment eligibility verification process. It also prohibits retaliation for conduct protected under the INA.None
