    Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Thursday announcing Joyce Branda as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division:     I am pleased that Joyce Branda, a dedicated public servant whom Ive known for years, will serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division.     Joyce's nearly 35 years of service to the American people has been defined by her unwavering commitment to public service and distinguished by her dogged pursuit of financial and health care fraud.  She has helped protect and advance the public interest by recovering billions of taxpayer dollars and holding accountable those who have defrauded the treasury.     "Over the last three years, Joyce has led the Civil Division's Commercial Litigation Branch to some of the largest settlements in its history  a track record of exemplary enforcement that I'm certain she will build upon in her new role.     "And, as Stuart Delery moves into his new role as Acting Associate Attorney General, I am confident that Joyce will lead the Civil Division with the same professionalism and exceptional skill that have been her hallmark."
