Two water treatment chemicals executives were indicted in Newark, New Jersey, for their roles in a conspiracy to eliminate competition among suppliers of liquid aluminum sulfate to municipalities and pulp and paper companies in the United States, the Department of Justice announced today.Vincent J. Opalewski, former president, vice president and general manager of a water treatment chemicals manufacturer headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, and Brian C. Steppig, director of sales and marketing of a water treatment chemicals manufacturer headquartered in Lafayette, Indiana, are the second and third executives charged in connection with the conspiracy, which sought to eliminate competition for contracts to supply liquid aluminum sulfate. Liquid aluminum sulfate is a coagulant used by municipalities to treat drinking and waste water and by pulp and paper companies in their manufacturing processes.Municipalities and pulp and paper companies deserve competitive prices for water treatment chemicals, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. These charges reflect our ongoing efforts to hold accountable those who conspire to cheat their customers responsible for their crimes.These charges send a message that anyone intent on corrupting the free market will be identified and brought to justice, said Acting Special Agent in Charge Andrew Campi of the FBIs Newark Division. Our mission is to protect victims who don't see these crimes occurring, but who always end up paying the price.The indictment, returned by a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that Opalewski, from 2005 to 2011, and Steppig, from 1998 until 2011, and their co-conspirators participated in the conspiracy by meeting to discuss each others liquid aluminum sulfate business, agreeing to stay away from each others historical customers, submitting intentionally losing bids to favor the intended winner of the business, withdrawing inadvertently winning bids and discussing with each other prices to be quoted to municipalities and pulp and paper companies.The charges contained in the indictment are allegations and not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.  NoneNone
