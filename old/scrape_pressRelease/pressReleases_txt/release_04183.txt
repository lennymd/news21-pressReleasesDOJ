NonePennington County and the department reached an agreement under Project Civic Access (PCA), the departments wide-ranging initiative to ensure that cities, towns and counties throughout the country comply with the ADA. One of the hallmarks of the agreement is the requirement that the county hire an independent licensed architect (ILA) who is knowledgeable about the architectural accessibility requirements of the ADA. The ILA will certify that the accessibility modifications done to the countys facilities comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design.The agreement with the county will allow people with disabilities to participate in and benefit from the services provided in Pennington Countys facilities including its New Administration Building, Courthouse Complex, Jail, Jail Annex, Public Safety Building, Public Health Building, Juvenile Services Center and the Pennington County Fairgrounds. The county will renovate and remediate everything from entrances, service areas, counters, restrooms and parking so that people with disabilities can get into county buildings and use the services and programs offered by the county in each of its buildings. In addition, the agreement calls for implementing a comprehensive plan to improve the accessibility of sidewalks, transportation stops and pedestrian crossings by installing accessible curb ramps throughout the county.NoneNone
