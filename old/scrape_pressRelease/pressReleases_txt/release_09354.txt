WASHINGTON  U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) employee Jack Chris Jackson, 45, was indicted today on charges of sexual abuse of an inmate and false statements, the Justice Department announced. The indictment alleges that on or about June 27, 2011, Jackson, while working in the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Miami, engaged in a sexual act with an inmate who was in the defendants custodial, supervisory and disciplinary authority. The indictment further alleges that, when questioned on July 1, 2011, the defendant falsely denied having sex with the inmate or any other inmate at FCI. If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum statutory sentence of 15 years in prison for the sexual abuse charge and a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the false statements charge. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. BOP wardens at FCI and Federal Detention Center provided full assistance and coordination throughout this investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Rhee Osborne of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Henry Leventis of the Civil Rights Division. Anyone with information concerning these offenses or related criminal conduct is encouraged to contact the FBI at 305-944-9101.
