The United States filed a complaint seeking to permanently bar a former Staten Island, New York, man and the tax preparation business he operates from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil complaint against Ranti Azeez-Taiwo and his business, Lot Associates Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges that Azeez-Taiwo prepares federal income tax returns for customers that understate their correct tax liabilities. The governments suit alleges that the understatements are the result of fabricated or inflated itemized deductions, particularly charitable deductions and unreimbursed employee business expense deductions, which are claimed on Schedule A, and sole-proprietorship business expenses, which are claimed on Schedule C. According to the complaint, an undercover Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent provided Azeez-Taiwo with information that should have resulted in a tax return showing more than $500 in tax due to be paid, but Azeez-Taiwo instead prepared a return claiming a refund of more than $500.NoneThe IRS estimates that Azeez-Taiwo has prepared more than 7,000 tax returns since 2006, the complaint alleges. The complaint further contends that the IRS has audited or examined over 250 returns prepared by Azeez-Taiwo and the total tax deficiency for those returns alone exceeds $773,000. According to the complaint, Azeez-Taiwos conduct could have caused more than $773,000 in harm to the U.S. Treasury.None
