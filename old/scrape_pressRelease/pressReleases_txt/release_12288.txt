Cruden, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division. "Maritime companies and their employees must understand that violations of our Nations laws are serious and the Justice Department stands ready to prosecute those who choose to ignore them."  "Our hope is that this case will send a strong message to those in the maritime community who might try to circumvent our nations anti-pollution laws. It is necessary to ensure that the companies realize that violating our environmental laws will be taken seriously, and will ultimately cost them more than legally disposing of the waste," said Michael K. Loucks, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.  "The Coast Guard is committed to working with the maritime industry and federal, state and local law enforcement partners to protect the U.S. maritime environment from individuals who pollute our waters," said Rear Admiral Dale G. Gabel, Commander of the First Coast Guard District in Boston, Mass. "When these violations occur, the Coast Guard will work with our partners to ensure violators are held accountable under the law."  The case was investigated by the U.S. Coast Guard, Coast Guard Investigative Service. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda M. Ricci of Loucks Economic Crimes Unit, Trial Attorney Todd Mikolop of the Justice Departments Environmental Crimes Section, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Jones of the U.S. Coast Guard First District Legal Office.
