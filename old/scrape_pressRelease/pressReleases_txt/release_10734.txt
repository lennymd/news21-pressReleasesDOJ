NoneNoneNoneNone      Todays announcement is another example of how allegations in a national financial fraud case can directly harm everyday people on Main Street, said U.S. Attorney MacBride. The alleged victims in this case are not banks or professional investors taking a calculated risk.  Instead, this case involves elderly retirees and others who gave most  and in some cases, all  of their life savings and have seen it all disappear.        These defendants allegedly defrauded unsuspecting investors of more than $100 million, often for their own personal enrichment, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. As a result of their alleged scheme, more than 800 victims across the United States and Canada were cheated out of their savings and deceived. Through the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force we are continuing to root out financial fraud in all its forms.  NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
