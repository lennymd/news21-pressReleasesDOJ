NoneThe purpose of the statement of interest, which does not take a position on the merits of the case, is to provide the court with a framework to assess the plaintiffs claim. The departments statement of interest explains the requirements to protect the rights of children, particularly children with disabilities, in their interactions with SROs. SROs can partner with schools to help maintain a safe and positive school environmentwhen their role is clearly defined and they are trained to perform it properly. However, if SROs do not observe appropriate limits on their role and responsibility, the Justice Department writes, they risk criminaliz[ing] school-related misbehavior and risk lasting and severe consequences for children, particularly children with disabilities.In its statement of interest, the Justice Department emphasizes that school resource officers should not handle routine disciplinary incidents that school officials should properly address. The brief also describes the particularized facts and circumstances the court should consider in evaluating whether the SROs conduct in this case was objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Finally, the department confirms that the ADA applies to SROs interactions with children with disabilities and that this statute requires SROs to make reasonable modifications in their procedures when necessary, and requires law enforcement agencies to change policies that discriminate against children with disabilities.None
