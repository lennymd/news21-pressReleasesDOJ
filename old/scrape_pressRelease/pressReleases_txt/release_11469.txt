None  According to the governments filings, Miller repeatedly prepared federal income tax returns claiming bogus refunds in "astonishing" amounts, based on a tax fraud scheme known as the "redemption" scheme. The court previously found that Miller prepared and filed 41 income tax returns for customers in 2009 claiming more than $8.3 million in fraudulent refunds. The court said that the redemption scheme is based on a frivolous theory that the federal government maintains secret accounts for its citizens, and that taxpayers can gain access to funds in those accounts by issuing IRS 1099-OID forms to their creditors.None  The Internal Revenue Service catches the vast majority of fraudulent redemption-scheme tax refund claims without issuing any refund.

DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked Justice Department trial attorney Brian H. Corcoran for handling the case, and also thanked Shauna Henline of the IRSs Small Business Self-Employed Division, who conducted the investigation.NoneNone
