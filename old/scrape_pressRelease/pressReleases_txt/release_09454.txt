None None       The indictment charges that Wright knowingly sold and provided an Ohio resident hunting license to a South Carolina resident during the 2006 white-tailed deer season.  According to the indictment, Wright falsely entered an Ohio address for the hunter in order to obtain a resident license. Ohio law makes it a crime to procure a hunting license by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or any false statement.  Ohio law also makes it a crime to hunt without a valid hunting license. The indictment charges that the hunter killed three white-tailed deer using the illegal license. Wright personally checked in the three deer, again providing the fraudulent Ohio address. The hunter then transported the deer back to South Carolina.         The indictment also alleges that Wright, using his authority as a wildlife officer, seized white-tailed deer antlers from a hunter who had killed a deer illegally during the 2009 white-tailed deer season.  The indictment alleges that, rather than dispose of the antlers through court proceedings, Wright caused the antlers to be transported to another individual in Michigan.  The indictment charges that Wright then filed an official state form which falsely reported that he had personally destroyed the antlers.       Two of the four counts charged in the indictment are felonies punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine per count.  The remaining two counts are misdemeanors punishable by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine per count.
