  Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS), a publicly traded mortgage servicing company based in Jacksonville, Fla., has agreed to pay $35 million in criminal penalties and forfeiture to address its participation in a six-year scheme to prepare and file more than 1 million fraudulently signed and notarized mortgage-related documents with property recorders offices throughout the United States.     The settlement, which follows a felony guilty plea from the chief executive officer of wholly owned LPS subsidiary DocX LLC, was announced today by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Robert E. ONeill.   The non-prosecution agreement, which LPS entered into today with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida, requires the company to make the payment and meet a series of other conditions.        Lorraine Brown, the former CEO of DocX LLC, pleaded guilty on Nov. 20, 2012, in federal court in Jacksonville to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.     During her guilty plea, Brown admitted to her leadership role in the scheme.           LPS has taken a number of remedial actions to address the misconduct at DocX.     Among other things, LPS has wound down all of DocXs operations, re-executed and re-filed mortgage assignments as appropriate and terminated Brown and others.     LPS has also demonstrated changes in its compliance, training and overall approach to ensuring its adherence to the law, and has retained an independent consultant to review and report on LPSs document execution practices; assess related operational, compliance, legal and reputational risks; and establish a plan for reimbursing any financial injuries to mortgage servicers or borrowers. NoneNone   After these documents were falsely signed and fraudulently notarized, Brown authorized DocX employees to file and record them with local county property records offices across the country.     Many of these documents  particularly mortgage assignments, lost note affidavits and lost assignment affidavits  were later relied upon in court proceedings, including property foreclosures and federal bankruptcy actions.        In entering into the non-prosecution agreement with LPS, the Justice Department took several factors into consideration.     Soon after discovering the misconduct at DocX, LPS conducted a thorough internal investigation, reported all of its findings to the government, cooperated with the governments investigation and effectively remediated any problems it discovered.     The governments investigation also revealed that Brown and others at DocX took various steps to actively conceal the misconduct from detection, including from LPS senior management and auditors.        Brown, 51, of Alpharetta, Ga., faces a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.     She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 23, 2013, before U.S. District Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr. in Jacksonville.   This case is being handled by Trial Attorney Ryan Rohlfsen and Assistant Chief Glenn S. Leon of the Justice Departments Criminal Division Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark B. Devereaux of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida.     The case is being investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the state of Floridas Department of Financial Services.      NoneNone
