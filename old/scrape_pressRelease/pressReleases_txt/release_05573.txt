  WASHINGTONAttorney General Eric Holder today released the following  statement regarding the U.S. Sentencing Commission vote approving retroactivity  of sentence reductions for drug offenses:  The department looks forward to implementing this plan to reduce sentences  for certain incarcerated individuals. We have been in ongoing discussions with  the Commission during its deliberations on this issue, and conveyed the  department's support for this balanced approach. In the interest of fairness, it  makes sense to apply changes to the sentencing guidelines retroactively, and the  idea of a one-year implementation delay will adequately address public safety  concerns by ensuring that judges have adequate time to consider whether an  eligible individual is an appropriate candidate for a reduced sentence. At my  direction, the Bureau of Prisons will begin notifying federal inmates of the  opportunity to apply for a reduction in sentence immediately. This is a  milestone in the effort to make more efficient use of our law enforcement  resources and to ease the burden on our overcrowded prison system.
