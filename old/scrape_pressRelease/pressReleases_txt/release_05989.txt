NoneNone  Thanks to a variety of effective, evidence-based reentry programs and services, were doing more than ever to ensure that the tens of thousands of federal inmates who return to their communities each year have access to the substance abuse treatment, job training, affordable housing, parenting education, and other resources that so many need to break the cycle of poverty, criminality, and incarceration.  Through innovative strategies like the Justice Departments Smart on Crime initiative, were working hard to tear down unnecessary barriers to opportunity and independence  while building up programs that enable former prisoners to reintegrate into their communities. And nowhere is this work stronger than at the Federal Bureau of Prisons  where groundbreaking efforts are underway to make our criminal justice expenditures both smarter and more productive.  Today, Im pleased to announce that the Justice Department  through the Bureau of Prisons  is taking a critical step forward that will enable us to build on this important work  and improve the way reentry programming is implemented from coast to coast.  For the first time, we will require all 200-plus halfway houses in the federal system to offer standardized treatment to prisoners with mental health and substance abuse issues. This treatment will be intensive, and must follow rigorous standards set forth by the Bureau of Prisons. Once fully implemented, these services will be available to every single one of the approximately 30,000 inmates who are released through halfway houses each year. This will ensure consistency and continuity of care between federal prisons and community-based facilities. And it will enhance the programs that help prisoners overcome their past struggles, get on the right path, and stay out of our criminal justice system.None
