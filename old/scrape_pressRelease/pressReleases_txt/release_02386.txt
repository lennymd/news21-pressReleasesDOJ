NoneFor more than 30 years, National Night Out has helped to prevent crime, strengthen community-police relationships, and empower neighborhoods across the United States, said Attorney General Lynch. By giving law enforcement and local residents a chance to gather in a positive and supportive environment, National Night Out forges the bonds of trust that are so essential to the creation of stronger, safer, and more united communities where every American can flourish. The Department of Justice is working tirelessly to help build those vibrant communities throughout our nation, and we are proud to stand alongside National Night Out in that vital effort.National Night Out is an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie to make our neighborhoods safer, better places to live. In most areas of the country, the program culminates annually on the first Tuesday of August. National Night Out organizers expect to hold more than 16,000 community events around the country this year.Established in 1984 from a Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) grant, the goal of National Night Out is to build relationships with and between communities and law enforcement, to promote crime prevention efforts, and to send a message to criminals that neighbors are paying attention and are prepared to work together to keep each other safe.
