  The Justice Department announced Monday that Attorney General Eric Holder has recorded a video message as part of the Cartoon Networks I Speak Up campaign to combat bullying. The project urges young people to speak up in order to help bring bullying situations to an end.   The goal of the campaign is to collect one million user-generated videos that unite the voices of kids, parents, educators, celebrities and government officials all saying I Speak Up. Attorney General Holder joined other notable voices such as Education Secretary Arne Duncan, as well as actors and professional athletes, in recording a message for the campaign.None None
