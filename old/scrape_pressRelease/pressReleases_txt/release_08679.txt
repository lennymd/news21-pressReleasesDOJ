The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania awarded summary judgment to the government on a finding that Daniel Allgyer, dba Rainbow Acres Farm and Rainbow Valley Farms, violated the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act, the Justice Department announced today. The court made the ruling on Feb. 3, 2012. Allgyer is the owner and operator of a dairy farm located in Kinzers, Pa. An investigation conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) showed that Allgyer was packaging unpasteurized milk (also known as raw milk) in unlabeled containers, and was then distributing the milk for human consumption in interstate commerce. None While some states, including Pennsylvania, permit the sale of unpasteurized milk, it is illegal to transport unpasteurized milk across state lines. Unpasteurized milk can contain a wide variety of harmful bacteria, including Listeria, E.coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia and Brucella. The FDA has determined that drinking raw milk can cause significant harm, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division. Working with our federal partners, we will bring enforcement actions like this one to ensure that the American food supply is safe and consumers are not exposed to such risks. We are pleased that the court has ordered Mr. Allgyer to stop distributing unpasteurized milk across state lines. This matter was handled by Department of Justice Trial Attorney Jessica R. Gunder of the Civil Divisions Consumer Protection Branch and Associate Chief Counsel Karen C. Corallo of the FDAs Office of the General Counsel.
