John Greene, 70, a former captain at the Gallup-McKinley Adult Detention Center (GMADC), entered a guilty plea to charges related to the sexual assaults of female inmates in his custody. Greene pleaded guilty to three counts of violating each of the victims right to bodily integrity by engaging in sexual contact against their will. Greene also pleaded guilty to two counts of making material false statements to the FBI when he denied both touching the breasts of one female inmate and having personal contact with another female inmate.According to court documents, Greene admitted that in his capacity as a captain at GMADC, he had regular access to female inmates when he accompanied them to court hearings, transported them to other facilities, and had them brought to his office. This regular access gave him the opportunity to engage in unwanted sexual contact with three different women in December 2008 and January 2009. Greene committed these acts, knowing it was wrong, against the law and without the victims consent, but he did so anyway for his own gratification.Greene also admitted that he lied to the FBI about his conduct on two occasions.Under the terms of the plea agreement, Greene will be sentenced to five years of probation. As part of the plea agreement, Greene will forfeit his law enforcement certification and must comply with sex offender registration requirements.A sentencing hearing has not yet been set.This case is being investigated by the Gallup Resident Agency of the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Holland S. Kastrin for the District of New Mexico and Fara Gold of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
