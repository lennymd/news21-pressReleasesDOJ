WASHINGTON The Justice Department today announced a settlement agreement with Beach Babies Learning Center LLC, located in Old Saybrook, Conn., to resolve allegations that the center terminated the enrollment of a then two-year-old child from its program because the child has autism. Based upon a c omprehensive medical history and physical examination, the childs pediatrician confirmed that the child was healthy and could participate in the programs at the center. Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, including autism, in early education and child care centers. Under the agreement, the center agreed to implement policies and procedures to ensure that children with disabilities are afforded a full and equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the centers programs. The center will also post a nondiscrimination policy at its facility and include the policy on its website. The center also agreed to pay monetary damages to the childs parents. Ensuring that children with disabilities, and their families, have equal access to early education and child care centers goes to the heart of the ADAs promises and protections, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Beach Babies Learning Center cooperated with the department to address this matter through this agreement, and we hope that this agreement serves as a reminder to other education and child care providers about their responsibilities under the ADA.None NoneNone
