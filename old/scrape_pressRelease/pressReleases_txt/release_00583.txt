A Greensboro, North Carolina, resident was sentenced today to 37 months in prison for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), filing a fraudulent tax return, and bankruptcy fraud, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra J. Hairston for the Middle District of North Carolina. None Nowlin also admitted that between 2011 and 2017, he earned hundreds of thousands of dollars operating a tax preparation business. Nowlin filed hundreds of tax returns for clients that claimed phony business and education expenses, sought refunds to which the clients were not entitled and did not identify him as the paid preparer. Nowlin caused the fees he earned to be deposited into nominee bank accounts that he controlled. Nowlin also admitted that he made false statements to IRS agents, including that he did not prepare tax returns for clients.  In addition to the tax-related charges, Nowlin also admitted to attempting to cheat his creditors by filing fraudulent personal bankruptcy petitions. Along with these petitions, Nowlin also submitted false financial statements on which he did not fully disclose his income and assets.  In addition to his term of imprisonment, U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles ordered Nowlin to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution to the IRS in the amount of $188,001.89. Nowlin pleaded guilty in August to obstructing the internal revenue laws, filing a fraudulent tax return, and bankruptcy fraud. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Hairston commended special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorney Robert J. Boudreau of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Anand P. Ramaswamy of the Middle District of North Carolina, who prosecuted the case. None
