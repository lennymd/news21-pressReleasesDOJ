None       Congress has made clear that colleges should not pay improper incentives to admissions recruiters, said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division Stuart F. Delery. The Department of Justice and the Department of Education are working together to combat unlawful recruitment practices that can harm students and result in the waste of taxpayer funds.        In its complaint, the government alleged that the college falsely certified compliance with provisions of federal law that prohibit a university from paying   incentive-based compensation   to its admissions recruiters based on the number of students they recruit. Congress enacted the prohibition on such incentive compensation to curtail the enrollment of unqualified students, high student loan default rates, and the waste of student loans and grant funds.       The claims alleged by the United States were initiated by a whistleblower lawsuit filed by two former Stevens-Henager employees under the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to file suit over false claims on behalf of the government. The act provides for the recovery of triple damages and penalties, and allows the government to intervene and take over the allegations, as it has done in this case. The whistleblower is entitled to a share of any recovery obtained in the lawsuit.        Fighting fraud and protecting federal tax dollars from abuse is a priority for this office, said U.S. Attorney Wendy Olson for the District of Idaho. The False Claims Act is an important tool for doing just that. Whistleblowers are necessary to our ongoing efforts to combat fraud, waste and abuse.       None
