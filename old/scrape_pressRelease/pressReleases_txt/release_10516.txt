NoneNone  Under this nationwide settlement, which must still be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, the defendants will adopt procedures to screen out discriminatory advertisements for housing from all the defendants publications that include advertisements for housing. The settlement requires the defendants to screen out discriminatory advertisements for housing that appear in print or that appear both in print and on any associated websites. The settlement also requires the defendants to undergo training on the requirements on the Fair Housing Act, post notices informing readers about the requirements of the FHA, provide monetary compensation to SSFHC, and make periodic reports to the government.  "The Fair Housing Act applies to all those who participate in the housing industry, including those who publish advertisements for dwellings," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "This settlement will help eliminate the atmosphere of intolerance created by discriminatory advertisements."  "Families struggling to find suitable housing shouldnt have their choices limited by discriminatory advertising and unlawful practices," stated John Trasvina, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. "HUD is committed to taking swift enforcement action anytime a familys right to obtain the housing of their choice is illegally denied." NoneNone
