None        The settlement announced today resolves claims against these contractors related to a CIA contract awarded   to   American Systems   in   early 2009   to   provide supplies and services.  American Systems teamed with   Anixter to bid on the contract with Corning as a supplier.  The United States alleged t  hat   American Systems, Anixter and Corning provided gratuities, including meals, entertainment, gifts and tickets to sporting and other events, to CIA employees and outside consultants in order to influence contract specifications that would favor the three companies in the award of the contract. The settlement also resolves allegations that the three companies improperly received source selection information from a CIA employee to whom they had provided gratuities, and that they had concealed the gratuities prior to award.     NoneNoneNone        This case clearly reflects that the CIA will respond effectively to allegations of fraud affecting agency programs, said CIA Inspector General David B. Buckley. My office treats contract fraud and related employee misconduct as one of our top investigative priorities, and we work closely with agency employees and the Department of Justice to ensure that illegal acts are addressed in an effective manner.NoneNone
