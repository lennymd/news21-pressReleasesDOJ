Today, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia announced that Kadarius Thomas, a former member of the Correctional Emergency Response Team (CERT) and a former supervisor at Macon State Prison (MSP), in Oglethorpe, Ga., pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice. Thomas is the fourth former MSP officer to enter a guilty plea in connection with an ongoing federal investigation into staff assaults of inmates at the prison.NoneMr. Thomas, by his statements, attempted to conceal the CERT teams practice of using force to punish an inmate they swore an oath to protect, said Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Jocelyn Samuels. Such actions have no place in our corrections system and the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who try to cover up such crimes.Michael J. Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, stated: Todays guilty plea is another example of the zero tolerance the Department of Justice has for correctional officers who use their position to try to cover up official misconduct.This case is being investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Special Litigation Counsel Forrest Christian and Trial Attorney Tona Boyd of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, with the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Georgia and the support of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
