  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced a settlement with the city of Walnut, Calif., resolving allegations that the city violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) when it denied the Chung Tai Zen Center of Walnut a permit to construct a Buddhist house of worship on property owned by the Zen Center, thus forcing the Zen Center to move to another facility in Pomona, Calif.   The settlement, which must still be approved by a federal district judge, resolves the lawsuit between the United States and the city of Walnut.    NoneNoneNone   The city has agreed, as part of settlement, not to impose differential zoning or building requirements on other houses of worship.   The city also agreed that its leaders and managers, and certain city employees, will attend training on the requirements of RLUIPA.   In addition, the city will adopt new procedures that clarify its appeals process for houses of worship, and will report periodically to the Justice Department. None
