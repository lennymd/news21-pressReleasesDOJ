    Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally for the Tax Division and U.S. Attorney David A. Capp of the Northern District of Indiana announced today that Ronald Eugene Jamerson, 56, of Schererville, Ind., was sentenced to serve 12 months and one day in prison by U.S. District Judge Phillip P. Simon. Jamerson was also ordered to pay $541,083 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid individual income taxes and employment taxes, which represents the total tax loss owed for all tax periods from 2003 through 2008, according to the plea agreement. On Oct. 25, 2013, Jamerson pleaded guilty to one count of willfully failing to truthfully account for, collect and pay over employment taxes to the IRS.     On June 20, 2012, Jamerson was indicted by a federal grand jury on 11 counts of willfully failing to file quarterly employment tax returns with the IRS and willfully failing to pay the IRS the federal income taxes and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes due and owing from the second quarter of 2006 through the fourth tax quarter of 2008. Jamerson is an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat surgeon) who opened his own medical practice in the late 1990s. According to court pleadings, Jamerson deducted and collected from his employees paychecks federal income taxes and employment taxes in the amount of $63,929 over the 11 tax quarters, but failed to file the employment tax returns and pay over the related employment taxes.         The case was investigated by Special Agents from IRS - Criminal Investigation and prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Erin S. Mellen and Chris J. Maietta of the Tax Division, with valuable support from the U.S. Attorneys Office in Hammond, Ind.
