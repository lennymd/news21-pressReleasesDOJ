      WASHINGTON  A retired colonel in the U.S. Army was sentenced today to 12 months in prison for her role in a scheme to pay bribes for contracts awarded in support of the Iraq war, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.           Levonda J. Selph, 57, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton of the District of Columbia.  In addition to her prison term, Selph was sentenced to three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and $9,000 in restitution.        Selph pleaded guilty in June 2008 to an information charging her with one count of bribery and one count of conspiracy.  According to the information, in 2005, then-Lt.

Selph accepted fraudulent bids from a co-conspirator contracting firm, and helped that firm to win the contract award.  In return for these actions, Selph accepted a vacation to Thailand and other things of value totaling approximately $9,000.        This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Richard B. Evans of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section and Trial Attorneys Mark W. Pletcher and Emily W. Allen of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and the Antitrust Division.
