A federal grand jury in Albuquerque, N.M., indicted John Greene, 70, a former captain at the Gallup-McKinley Adult Detention Center (GMADC), on charges related to the sexual assaults of women inmates in his custody. Greene is charged with three counts of violating the civil rights of three different victims by engaging in unwanted sexual contact with the victims while they were incarcerated at GMADC. The indictment also charges Greene with two counts of making material false statements to the FBI. Specifically, one count charges Greene with lying to the FBI when he denied touching the breasts of a woman in his custody, and the second count charges Greene with lying to the FBI when he denied having any personal contact with another woman in his custody. The indictment alleges that Greene knew these statements were false at the time that he made them because he had, in fact, touched the breasts of these women.Greene faces a statutory maximum sentence of 13 years in prison for all of the crimes charged in the indictment. An indictment is merely an accusation and Greene is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the Gallup Resident Agency of the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Baker for the District of New Mexico and Fara Gold of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.
