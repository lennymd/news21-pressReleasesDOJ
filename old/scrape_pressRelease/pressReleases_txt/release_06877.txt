      A federal grand jury in Scranton, Penn., returned an indictment today charging Jessie Con-Ui, a federal inmate, with the murder of federal corrections officer Eric Williams, the Justice Department announced.       Con-Ui, 36, was charged in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania with one count of first degree murder, one count of first degree murder of a U.S. corrections officer and one count of possessing contraband in prison.       The indictment alleges that Con-Ui killed Williams on Feb. 25, 2013, in a premeditated attack at the Canaan Federal Correction Complex in Waymart, Penn. According to the indictment, Con-Ui stabbed Williams with a sharpened weapon and struck him repeatedly.       If convicted, Con-Ui faces a maximum penalty of death or life in prison.         The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.        The charges against Con-Ui resulted from an investigation by the FBI, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The case is being prosecuted by the Justice Departments Criminal Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
