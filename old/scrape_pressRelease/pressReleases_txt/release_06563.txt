  Child Cyber Safety Night at the Ballpark is the latest effort by the Justice Department and its law enforcement and community partners to encourage parents to speak with their children about online and cell phone safety and provide prevention materials. As part of the event, the Department will receive the Washington Nationals Spirit Award. Deputy Attorney General James Cole will be recognized in an on field ceremony at Nationals Park along with Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Administrator Robert L. Listenbee, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office Valerie Parlave and public outreach organization I Know Better founder Steve Schankman.  The spirit award will be announced at 6:20 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21, 2013, before the 7:05 p.m. Major League Baseball game between the Washington Nationals and the Miami Marlins.  In a new public service announcement to be released at the game, Attorney General Eric Holder will emphasize the importance of creating an ongoing dialogue with children about safe use of technology.  As a parent, I understand the opportunities  and the challenges  that new technologies present for Americas young people. Its up to each of us to start a dialogue with our kids about safe Internet and cell phone practices, said Attorney General Holder in the public service announcement. Together, we can ensure that our kids are safe and protected  both online and off.None  Press inquiries regarding logistics should be directed to Alex Schauffler at Alexandra.Schauffler@nationals.com and Kelly McMahon at kelly@INOBTR.org.
