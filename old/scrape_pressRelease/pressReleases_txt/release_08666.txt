None None       During Velasquezs trial, the government presented evidence of multiple murders committed by MS-13 members in 2008.   Several of the victims were not involved in gangs or any illegal activity, including a 14-year-old, but were mistaken to be rival gang members by MS-13 members.       The evidence at trial showed that on Feb. 19, 2009, Velasquez and fellow gang members Luis Herrera, aka Killer and Jaime Balam, aka Tweety, went looking to kill rival gang members in the San Francisco Bay area.  In the Excelsior District of San Francisco, they spotted a car of young Latino professionals  two were college graduates of UC Berkeley, one a law student at UC Hastings, one a bank employee and another a student at City College in San Francisco who was working his way through school at the time.  According to evidence presented at trial, these victims were targeted because some of the men wore baseball caps in colors associated with rival gang members.  None of the victims were gang members themselves.       Herrera, Velasquez and Balam followed the victims car into Daly City, Calif., boxed the car in at a red light, whereupon Velasquez and Balam flanked the victims car carrying semi-automatic handguns and began shooting.  By the time they finished firing, they had severely wounded two of the passengers and murdered a third passenger, Moises Frias Jr.  Frias, who was 21-years-old, suffered nine gunshot wounds, including several to the head.  He died en route to the hospital.         Herrera pleaded guilty mid-trial to seven racketeering-related counts, including use of a firearm causing the death of Frias.  As part of his plea, Herrera admitted that he was part of the MS-13 hunting party that followed the victims car and murdered Frias.  Herrera was sentenced on Jan. 24, 2012, to 35 years in prison.  Balam remains a fugitive.
