      Attorney General Eric Holder and Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Mary Lou Leary today announced that four new cities will join a White House initiative to prevent youth violence. New Orleans, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Camden, N.J., will join the six original cities in the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention to reduce youth violence and gang activity and improve public safety.  None      Launched in 2010 at the direction of President Obama, the forum is a network of communities and federal agencies that share information and support local efforts to prevent and reduce youth violence.        Youth violence is not a problem any of us can solve alone, but by working together  by pooling resources and ideas  we have the ability to reduce youth violence in our communities, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Leary.        The 10 cities will participate in a working session this fall and highlight their strategies to address youth violence at a national summit in Washington, D.C., next spring.  The new cities were selected through a competitive application process. The six original cities are Boston; Chicago; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Salinas, Calif.; and San Jose, Calif.            As education and civic leaders, keeping kids safe is key to preparing them for healthy, happy, successful futures in school and beyond, said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Spreading community-led efforts to reduce youth violence will enable children to live up to their fullest potential while also contributing to greater safety and prosperity for everyone within those communities, and for our entire nation.      The forums federal partners include the Departments of Justice, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development and Labor; the Corporation for National and Community Service; and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.      Since the forum began, the cities have leveraged new partnerships with foundations and private corporations to prevent youth violence and have initiated a number of programs for youth and families in their communities. Earlier this year, Casey Family Programs sponsored activities for forum youth representatives at the national summit in Washington, D.C. Additionally, retail company Target awarded grants of $10,000 to the six forum sites to hire a youth director in each community. NoneNoneNone
