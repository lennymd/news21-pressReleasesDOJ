  WASHINGTON  A federal jury in Houston today convicted Ben Harris Echols, 63, of Houston, for conspiring to commit healthcare fraud by falsifying plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries, including patients whom he did not treat. After a four day trial, the jury convicted Echols of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and six counts of false statements relating to health care matters.None  Evidence presented at trial showed that Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care fraudulently billed Medicare for home health services and were paid approximately $17.3 million by Medicare, including $5.5 million for beneficiaries for whom Echols signed a plan of care.  At trial, doctors in whose names claims were submitted to Medicare testified that they were treating the patients on plans of care signed by Echols, and that the patients did not need the care that had been billed to Medicare based on the plans. Two Medicare beneficiaries for whom Echols signed plans of care testified at trial that they had never seen Echols, that they had different primary care physicians, and they did not want or need home health care.  The conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine; each of the false statements counts carries a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for March 14, 2013.  The case was tried by Trial Attorneys Alexander H. Berlin, Abigail B. Taylor and Senior Trial Attorney Joseph S. Beemsterboer, with assistance from Trial Attorneys Kyle Maurer and Alison Anderson of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.None  To learn more about the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), go to: www.stopmedicarefraud.gov
