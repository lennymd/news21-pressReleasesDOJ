  Army Soldier Naeem Williams, 34, will receive a life sentence for murdering his  five-year-old daughter, Talia Williams, after a federal jury in Honolulu,  Hawaii, reported today it was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether to  impose the death penalty.NoneNone   The evidence presented at trial  demonstrated that Naeem Williams and his wife Delilah Williams beat Talia  Williams almost daily.  Naeem Williams testified that the abuse was aimed at  disciplining his daughter as a result of bathroom accidents and was exacerbated  due to frustrations he was experiencing in his marriage.  The evidence indicated  the defendants physical abuse included punching Talia repeatedly, commanding  her to eat her own feces, and using duct tape to bind her from head to toe to a  bed post where she was whipped with a belt.  In the hours preceding Talias  death, Williams struck a frontal blow to Talia and her head slammed backwards  against the floor.  Talia then appeared to have a seizure.   This case was investigated by the  FBI and the Army Criminal Investigation Division.  The case was prosecuted by  Trial Attorney Steve Mellin from the Capital Case Section of the Justice  Departments Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren Ching.
