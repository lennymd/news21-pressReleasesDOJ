Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Thursday after Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole announced his plans to depart the Justice Department in the coming months:Over the past four years, Jim Cole has been my indispensable partner in leading the U.S. Department of Justice and extending the promise of equality under the law for everyone in this country. Jim's leadership and ingenuity have been critical in attaining historic results on behalf of the American people. During times of great challenge and unprecedented resource constraints, I have relied upon Jim to ensure that the Justice Department operates as effectively and efficiently as possible. His guidance and wise counsel have made him an irreplaceable advisor, a proven and trusted leader, and a champion for the cause of justice. I have been proud to count him as a colleague and a friend for nearly four decades. I thank him for his tireless work and faithful service over the years. And although he will be dearly missed by dedicated public servants at every level of the Justice Department, Im happy that well be able to work together in the coming months.
