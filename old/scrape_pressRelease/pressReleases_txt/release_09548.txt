   WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today reached a settlement with Brand Energy and Infrastructure Services and its subsidiary, Industrial Services LLC (ISI), resolving allegations that ISI, which provides craft services to industry, engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against non-citizens in the hiring and employment eligibility verification process.      The departments investigation was prompted after a work-authorized immigrant lost his job when he could not comply with ISIs request to provide specific employment documentation beyond what was required by law.   Further investigation revealed that ISIs Prairieville, La., office required all newly hired non-U.S. citizens to present documents issued by the Department of Homeland Security upon hire.   The company did not require U.S. citizens to present any particular documents.   Under the Immigration and Nationality Acts (INAs) anti-discrimination provision, employers are not allowed to discriminate against work-authorized employees during the hiring and employment eligibility verification process.    None   The Justice Department will continue to protect the right of work-authorized immigrants to work without having to overcome discriminatory hurdles during the hiring process, said Thomas E. Perez, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. We are pleased to have reached a settlement in this matter, and will continue to educate the public about the anti-discrimination provision of the INA.None
