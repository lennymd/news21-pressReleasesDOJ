      Nakia Jackson, of Montgomery, Alabama, was sentenced to serve 87 months in prison today for conspiring to defraud the United States and one count of aggravated identity theft for his role in a stolen identity refund fraud scheme, announced Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally of the Justice Department's Tax Division, U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr. for the Middle District of Alabama and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).       According to court documents, between January 2009 and March 2011, Jackson obtained stolen identities from an Alabama state employee and used those identities to file false tax returns. Jackson recruited a bank employee, LaQuanta Clayton, to assist him in depositing the false income tax refunds into various bank accounts. He obtained permission from several individuals to use their bank accounts to receive false refunds and when a false refund was deposited, Jackson would direct the individuals to withdraw the money and give the money to him. In total, Jackson filed over 100 false tax returns and requested over $400,000 in refunds.       In addition, Jackson was ordered to serve three years of supervised release and pay $212,856 in restitution.       IRS-Criminal Investigation agents investigated this case and Trial Attorneys Charles M. Edgar Jr. and Michael Boteler for the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Brown are prosecuting the case. None
