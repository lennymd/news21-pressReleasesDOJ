  Attorney General Eric Holder issued the following statement today in response to a federal jury in Manhattan unanimously reaching a guilty verdict against Abu Hamza al-Masri:  In both word and deed, Abu Hamza supported the cause of violent extremism. His conviction is as just as it was swift. This case is all the more noteworthy since it continues a trend of successful prosecutions of top terrorism suspects in our federal court system. With each efficiently delivered guilty verdict against a top al Qaeda-linked figure, the debate over how to best seek justice in these cases is quietly being put to rest.
