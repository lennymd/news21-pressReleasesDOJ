The Justice Department filed a proposed consent decree today with 30 Hop restaurant and bar in Coralville, Iowa, resolving claims that the establishment violated the new construction requirements of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).The ADA requires newly constructed facilities to comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. 30 Hop, which opened for business in 2014, is a newly constructed multi-story restaurant and bar with a rooftop patio. The departments complaint alleges that 30 Hop does not provide an accessible route to the rooftop patio or lower level, has an inaccessible entrance, has no accessible dining tables and has inaccessible bathrooms.All newly constructed restaurants and bars must be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We commend the owners of 30 Hop for cooperating with the Justice Department and for taking swift action to remedy the alleged ADA violations.Under the consent decree, which is subject to court approval, the owners of 30 Hop will, among other things, install an elevator between the ground floor and rooftop patio, install a platform lift between the ground floor and the lower level, provide accessible dining surfaces in each area of the restaurant and bar, provide closed risers on the staircase to the rooftop patio, increase the maneuvering clearance at the entrance door, bring the bathrooms into compliance with the ADA requirements for newly constructed facilities, pay a $17,500 civil penalty and pay $3,500 to compensate an individual with a disability who is not able to access the rooftop patio.None30 Hop Consent Decree
