        WASHINGTON  As part of Attorney General Eric Holders call for cost-cutting measures to streamline operations and reduce spending during a time of constrained funding, the Department of Justice today announced that it will realign functions in various offices, lower lease costs by consolidating or reducing office space and continue to look for ways to more effectively utilize the departments resources.  The measures respond to the Presidents and the Attorney Generals directives to reduce spending and to develop operational efficiencies.  The total cost savings for the actions announced today total more than $130 million.         In January 2011, Attorney General Holder issued a memorandum ordering a department-wide temporary hiring freeze and also instructed all components to limit travel, training and conference spending to only those needs that are essential.  The departments efforts have yielded significant reductions in conference spending in the first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2011, with conference spending down by $14 million over the same period last year.  The Attorney Generals order, which is still in place, was designed to keep the department operating effectively within constrained funding levels.           The Department of Justice is seeking ways to do more with less while we maintain our commitment to our critical law enforcement mission and our most important public safety priorities, said Attorney General Holder.  These cost-saving and efficiency measures have assisted us in utilizing our limited resources in the most effective way possible.  We will continue to identify additional areas where we can achieve savings and efficiencies to streamline our operations.         Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole provided further guidance to component heads in a February 2011 memorandum seeking operational and programmatic efficiencies in order to ensure sufficient funding for the departments essential public safety missions, including protecting Americans against terrorism and threats to national security, and protecting against violent crimes.         The department highlighted the success of the Attorney Generals Advisory Council for Savings and Efficiencies (SAVE Council), which thus far, has provided more than $51 million in savings to the department.      The SAVE Council, which was created in July 2010, provides a framework to identify and implement best practices for saving taxpayer money, realizing efficiencies, and monitoring the departments savings progress.  The following are examples of additional SAVE Council actions:         Administrative Notices on Forefeiture.gov  An initiative is underway to publish administrative asset forfeiture notices on the Internet instead of in newspapers. This initiative will reduce costs by $4.5 million annually, simplify the noticing process, and increase the availability of information to the public  ensuring that more of the ill-gotten gains from criminal activities will be available to fight crime.         Permanent Change of Station Reform  The department has revised a longstanding policy that provides benefits to employees when they are reassigned from one duty station to another.  The new policy limits the number of days an employee may be reimbursed for temporary quarters expenses to 60 days from 120 days.  This change will save the department approximately $10.3 million per year.         Debt Collection  The department   administers a Nationwide Central Intake Facility where federal agencies can refer delinquent debt in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act, for judgment or enforced collection.  The department is the collector of last resort, and most claims referred to the NCIF have undergone multiple collection attempts.  The department has negotiated an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service that will increase our efficiency in locating debtors and collecting the money that is owed to the Treasury and various federal agencies.             In addition to the SAVE Council actions, more than $50.4 million in other savings and efficiency measures have been implemented or are proposed:    NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone         Consolidating and eliminating unnecessary office space complies with President Obamas order to dispose of unneeded federal real estate, which saves American taxpayer dollars, Attorney General Holder added.           The department said that some of these cost savings may be immediate while others may not be realized until future fiscal years.
