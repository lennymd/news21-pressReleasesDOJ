Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division has signed an antitrust cooperation agreement with the Colombian antitrust agency on behalf of the Department of Justice. The agreement also was signed by Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, and went into effect today with the signature of Pablo Felipe Robledo, Colombias Superintendent of Industry and Commerce. The agreement will enable the antitrust agencies in the two countries to further enhance their law enforcement relationship.The new agreement contains provisions for antitrust enforcement cooperation and coordination, conflict avoidance and consultations with respect to enforcement actions, and technical cooperation. The agreement also contains confidentiality protections.The U.S. antitrust agencies and Colombias Superintendence of Industry and Commerce, the agency that enforces Colombias competition law, have built a strong enforcement relationship over the years, both bilaterally and under the terms of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.The Colombians have a proven antitrust system, and this agreement will allow us to work more closely with our colleagues in Bogot, said Assistant Attorney General Baer. Enforcement cooperation based on sound policies is critical to maintaining competitive markets in the Americas, particularly for economies as linked as ours.Colombia has a well-developed competition regime, and we have a strong working relationship with its competition agency, said Chairwoman Ramirez. We look forward to working with the Superintendence to advance our shared goal of promoting convergence around sound competition policy throughout the hemisphere.Highlights of the new agreement include:The agreement entering into force today does not change existing law in either country. Colombia has had a law dedicated to the preservation of competition since 1959. This cooperation agreement is similar in substance to those previously signed by the U.S. antitrust agencies with other jurisdictions in the Americas, including Brazil, Canada, Chile and Mexico.NoneDOJ MEDIA CONTACT: Emily Pierce, Office of Public Affairs 202-514-2007FTC MEDIA CONTACT: Peter Kaplan, Office of Public Affairs 202-236-2334
