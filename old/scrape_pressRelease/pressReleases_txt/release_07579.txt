  A federal grand jury in Trenton, N.J., returned an indictment charging David Moleski with 14 counts of mail fraud, one count of wire fraud, one count of corruptly impeding the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws and three counts of filing false claims for tax refunds, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.   According to the indictment, Moleski attempted to extinguish both public and private debts by mailing to creditors fake financial instruments, entitled secured promissory notes, that purported to draw against non-existent accounts at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition, Moleski submitted three false tax returns with the IRS, in which he claimed tax refunds of approximately $1.2 million to which he was not entitled.  An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted on all counts, Moleski faces a maximum potential sentence of 318 years in prison.   This case was investigated by special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Tino M. Lisella and Yael Epstein of the Justice Departments Tax Division are prosecuting the case.
