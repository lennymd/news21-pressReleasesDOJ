  A federal jury in Orlando, Fla, found Erin Sharma, a Bureau of Prisons corrections officer, guilty today on felony federal civil rights charges related to a fatal assault on an inmate in March 2005. Sharma was convicted on two charges, one count of conspiring to violate the federal civil rights of inmate Richard Delano, and a second count of violating Delanos civil rights by arranging for another inmate to assault Delano. Each count carries a sentence of up to life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing hearing has been set for Oct. 26, 2009.  The evidence at trial showed that on Feb. 28, 2005, Sharma and a co-conspirator agreed to move Delano into the cell of another inmate at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Coleman, Fla. The evidence also showed that Sharma and the co-conspirator knew that the inmate was likely to assault Delano, and that this move was in retaliation for a prior altercation between Delano and Sharma. Sharma also encouraged the inmate to assault Delano. The co-conspirator moved Delano into the inmates cell on March 1, 2005. On March 4, 2005, the inmate assaulted Delano. Delano later died from the injuries he suffered during that assault. None  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bruce Ambrose and Carolyn Adams from the U.S. Attorneys Office, and Senior Litigation Counsel Gerard Hogan and Trial Attorney Douglas Kern from the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Jim Raby was the lead investigator on the case.
