WASHINGTON  Two California real estate investors have agreed to plead guilty today for their roles in a conspiracy to rig bids and to commit mail fraud at public real estate foreclosure auctions in Northern California, the Department of Justice announced.NoneThe Antitrust Division will vigorously pursue fraudulent schemes that eliminate competition from the marketplace and cause financial harm to victims, said Sharis A. Pozen, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. The collusion taking place at these auctions preyed on the misfortune caused by the unprecedented rate of foreclosures and lined the pockets of colluding real estate investors with funds that otherwise would have gone to lenders and, at times, homeowners.The FBI and the Antitrust Division are partners in the fight to bring to justice those who engage in fraudulent anticompetitive practices at foreclosure auctions, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephanie Douglas. We are committed to holding those individuals accountable for the damage they have done to the real estate market and to unsuspecting victims.The department said that the primary purpose of the conspiracies was to suppress and restrain competition and to conceal payoffs in auction records in order to obtain selected real estate offered at public foreclosure auctions in Alameda and Contra Costa counties at noncompetitive prices. When real estate properties are sold at these auctions, the proceeds are used to pay off the mortgage and other debt attached to the property, with remaining proceeds, if any, paid to the homeowner. NoneEach violation of the Sherman Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals. Each count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The maximum fine for the Sherman Act charges may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victim if either amount is greater than the $1 million statutory maximum.The charges against Larsen and Powers are the latest cases filed by the department in its ongoing investigation into bid rigging and fraud at public real estate foreclosure auctions in Contra Costa County and Alameda County. To date, as a result of the investigation, 10 individuals have agreed to plead guilty.NoneNone**The fraud charge(s) referenced in this press release were subsequently dismissed on the governments motion.**
