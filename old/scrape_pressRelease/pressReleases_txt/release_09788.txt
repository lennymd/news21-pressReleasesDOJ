    WASHINGTON  A public service announcement (PSA) featuring Attorney General Eric Holder began airing this week on the Investigation Discovery network.  This 30-second PSA is part of the Attorney Generals Defending Childhood initiative to address the issue of childrens exposure to violence.     This PSA calls on all of us to take action to protect our children from violence in communities across the country, said Attorney General Holder. We can protect and heal the most vulnerable among us and transform the country for the betterone child at a time.     The goals of the initiative are to prevent childrens exposure to violence as victims and witnesses, to mitigate the negative effects that children exposed to violence experience, and to develop knowledge about and increase public awareness of this issue.      A key component of the Defending Childhood initiative is a multi-year demonstration program to develop comprehensive, community-based strategies to prevent and reduce the impact of childrens exposure to violence in their homes, schools and communities. In 2010, eight planning grants were awarded to begin this process to the City of Boston; the City of Portland, Maine; the Chippewa Cree Tribe of Montana; the City of Grand Forks, N.D.; the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Board of Commissioners; the Multnomah County, Oreg., Department of Human Services; the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, S.D.; and Shelby County, Tenn.
