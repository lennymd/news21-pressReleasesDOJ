None  Granados, 54, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Joan A. Lenard in U.S. District Court in Miami to conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).      Jorge Granados today admitted to authorizing illegal bribe payments to Honduran officials, and now he must pay for his crime, said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. Foreign bribery undermines competition in the marketplace, and weakens democratic institutions. CEOs and other corporate executives should know that now, more than ever, violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act will lead to criminal prosecution.   Todays plea reflects the FBIs commitment to aggressively pursue individuals and businesses that engage in corruption around the globe, said Special Agent in Charge John V. Gillies of the FBIs Miami Field Office.   Those who elect to pay illegal bribes to further their business interests in the United States or abroad should know that they are not beyond the reach of the FBI. We will work with our law enforcement partners and prosecutors to bring these corrupt individuals to justice.   Business executives should beware that paying bribes in foreign countries leads to prosecution in the United States, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton.   Our Foreign Corruption Investigative group will continue to provide resources and support to our international partners in an effort to fight corrupt business practices.
