The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan has issued an order permanently barring Mia Jordan, a Southfield, Michigan, tax preparer, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Jordan consented to the civil injunction order.According to the complaint, Jordan operated a business that provided tax return preparation support services under the name MIA-FILE as recently as 2014. The complaint states that Jordan, through MIA-FILE, prepared approximately 371 tax returns for tax processing years 2013 and 2014. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed examinations on 94 of the tax returns prepared by MIA-FILE, and 87, or 95 percent, of those examined returns resulted in additional tax assessments, the complaint alleges. Many of the returns that Jordan prepared for customers allegedly contained false deductions and credits, including inflated deductions for charitable contributions, home mortgage interest and real estate taxes. The complaint also states that the returns manipulated taxpayer data for the purposes of claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, for which the customer would otherwise be ineligible.NoneNone
