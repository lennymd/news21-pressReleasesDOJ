Jason Glenn Thomas, 35, a former City of Tuscaloosa Police sergeant in Tuscaloosa, Ala., was sentenced today to serve ten years in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release for sexually assaulting a Tuscaloosa woman in violation of federal civil rights laws. A special assessment of $100.00 was also imposed. Thomas pleaded guilty on April 18, 2013 to willfully violating the civil rights of a woman in his custody. According to court documents filed in connection with his guilty plea, Thomas admitted that shortly after midnight on May 28, 2011, he stopped and detained a female pedestrian without placing her under arrest. Thomas then transported the woman in a department issued patrol vehicle to a remote area and sexually assaulted her. Officers who sexually assault individuals in their custody defy the public trust bestowed upon law enforcement officials, and their actions will not be tolerated, said Jocelyn Samuels Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will continue to investigate and prosecute law enforcement officials that violate their oath to protect their communities. Although most police officers serve and protect the public with integrity, we remain deeply committed to prosecuting those few who, as defendant Thomas did, dishonor their badge by using it to take advantage of those they are sworn to protect said Joyce White Vance, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. This case was investigated by the Tuscaloosa resident agency of the FBIs Birmingham Field Office, and was prosecuted by Trial Attorney D.W. Tunnage of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney George Martin for the Northern District of Alabama.
