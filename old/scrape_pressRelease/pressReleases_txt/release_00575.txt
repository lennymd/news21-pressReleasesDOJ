A Nebraska man was sentenced today to six years in prison for child pornography offenses, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Robert C. Stuart of the District of Nebraska.  Robert Louis Bergstrom, 47, of Omaha, Nebraska, pleaded guilty on July 20, to receipt and distribution of child pornography. U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Rossiter Jr. of the District of Nebraska sentenced Bergstrom and also ordered him to serve 10 years of supervised release. In May 2016, law enforcement identified an IP address belonging to Bergstroms residence as sharing child pornography images on a peer-to-peer file sharing network. Devices seized from his home during a federal search warrant in August 2016 contained numerous videos and images constituting child pornography. When interviewed by law enforcement, Bergstrom admitted that he had specifically searched for and downloaded child pornography.  The charges are the result of an investigation by the FBIs Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. The matter is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P. Norris of the District of Nebraska. Trial Attorney Jessica L. Urban of CEOS also served as a member of the prosecution team at earlier stages of the litigation. None
