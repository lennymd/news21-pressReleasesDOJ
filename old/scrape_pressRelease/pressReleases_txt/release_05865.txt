  WASHINGTONOn January 3, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence declassified and disclosed publically that the U.S. government had filed an application with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking renewal of the authority to collect telephony metadata in bulk, and that, the FISC renewed that authority. The Office of the Director National Intelligence also announced that the Administration was undertaking a declassification review of the FISC's January 3 primary order. On February 12, 2014, and following a declassification review by the Executive Branch, the FISC released in redacted form the previously classified January 3 primary order it had issued in Docket Number BR 14-01, along with a number of other documents.  On January 22, 2014, following service of a Section 215 production order issued to it by the FISC in Docket Number BR 14-01, a provider petitioned the Court to "vacate, modify, or reaffirm" the production order in light of the Memorandum Opinion issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Klayman, et al., v. Obama, et al., No. 13-cv-0851 on December 16, 2013. That Memorandum Opinion held, in the context of ruling on a motion for preliminary injunction, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the NSA Section 215 program authorized by orders of the FISC violated the Fourth Amendment.  On March 20, 2014, the FISC issued an Opinion and Order addressing the provider's petition. The FISC held that the district court's opinion in Klayman was unpersuasive, concluded that it provided no basis for vacating the production order, and held that Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979) is the controlling precedent. Accordingly, the FISC reaffirmed its production order and directed continued compliance on the part of the provider.NoneNone
