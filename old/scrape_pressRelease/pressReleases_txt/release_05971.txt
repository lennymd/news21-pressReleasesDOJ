NoneNone       In 1979, the department determined that entering into perpetual decrees was not in the public interest. Since that time, decrees have included sunset provisions that will automatically terminate them after a term of years, not to exceed 10 years. Most decrees entered into before 1980 do not contain this provision.       The new streamlined procedure will expedite the review process for legacy decrees and will benefit both the defendants and the department by eliminating costly and time intensive investigations, said Bill Baer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. The Antitrust Division will continue to look for ways to incorporate procedural efficiencies whenever possible as it is an important part of effective antitrust enforcement.None None       Under the protocol, the requesting party will publish, at its own expense, notice of its intent to seek termination or modification and invite interested parties to provide the Antitrust Division with relevant information. The division will work with the requesting party to determine what form of cost-effective notice is appropriate. Because the process is expedited, the division believes that a pre-filing public comment period best serves the public interest by allowing interested parties to come forward early in the process so that their concerns may be considered and addressed prior to the filing of a motion to modify or terminate. The division will take into account issues that are brought to its attention and address them as appropriate. Other parts of the 1999 protocol will remain in effect.
