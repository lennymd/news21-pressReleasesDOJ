  WASHINGTON  A Laurel Springs, N.J., wastewater treatment and chemical supply company and its owner were sentenced today for participating in a fraud conspiracy in connection with sub-contracts for wastewater treatment supplies and services at two Superfund sites in New Jersey, the Department of Justice announced today.   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-designated Superfund sites are the Federal Creosote Superfund site in Manville, N.J., and the Diamond Alkali Superfund site in Newark, N.J. None   According to court documents, Drimak paid approximately $411,000 in kickbacks to co-conspirators, at both the Federal Creosote and Diamond Alkali sites, in exchange for their assistance in allocating certain sub-contracts to J.M.J. Environmental.   The department said that the kickbacks were in the form of checks, cash, paid vacations, home renovations, boat trailers and payment of personal business expenses.   The cleanup at Federal Creosote is partly funded by the EPA.   An interagency agreement between the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers designated that the EPA hire the prime contractors at Federal Creosote.   According to a settlement with the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Tierra Solutions was required to fund remedial action and maintenance of Diamond Alkali.   Tierra Solutions hired the prime contractor for the remedial action and maintenance of Diamond Alkali.     Including Drimak and J.M.J Environmental, 10 individuals and three companies have been charged in this investigation.   More than $3 million in criminal fines and restitution have been imposed and four individuals have been sentenced to jail. None
