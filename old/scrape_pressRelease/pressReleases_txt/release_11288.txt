WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Monroe City School District in Louisiana to address the educational inequities between schools serving virtually all black student populations and those schools that serve most of the districts white students. The settlement agreement, in the form of a consent decree and subject to court approval, stems from a longstanding desegregation order governing the Monroe City School District to ensure that the district complies with Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and provides all students with the equal protections of the law.None"Education is the most important gift we can give to children to help them succeed, and all students must have access to a quality education that provides them with equal opportunities, regardless of their race," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "We will continue to ensure that all students have such access and will carefully scrutinize school districts that operate pursuant to federal desegregation orders to ensure that these districts are meeting their obligations to their students."The enforcement of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IV in school districts is a top priority of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.
