Attorney General Jeff Sessions today released the following statement on the Ninth Circuits decision on President Trumps Executive Order:President Trumps Executive Order is well within his lawful authority to keep the Nation safe. We disagree with the Ninth Circuits decision to block that authority.Recent attacks confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real. Certain countries shelter or sponsor terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, and we may be unable to obtain any reliable background information on individuals from these war-torn, failed states. We must not place our nation at risk until we have the ability accurately and responsibly to vet those seeking entry here. The President was clear in his landmark speech in Saudi Arabia: this is not about religion; it is about national security. In fact, the President called upon leaders in the Muslim world to join the United States in protecting religious freedom for all, including the freedom to be free from violence and terror. The Executive Branch is entrusted with the responsibility to keep the country safe under Article II of the Constitution. Unfortunately, this injunction prevents the President from fully carrying out his Article II duties and has a chilling effect on security operations overall.President Trump knows that the country he has been elected to lead is threatened daily by terrorists who believe in a radical ideology, and that there are active plots to infiltrate the U.S. immigration system -- just as occurred prior to 9/11. The President is committed to protecting the American people and our national security, and we are proud to support his mission to put America first by defending his right to keep us safe. That is why the Department of Justice will continue to seek further review by the Supreme Court.
