Today, a federal grand jury in Milwaukee returned a 15-count superseding indictment charging two Milwaukee men, Paul Carter aka Pimpin Paul and David Moore aka King David with conspiracy, sex trafficking and related offenses spanning from the years 2007 to 2013. Carter, 44, and Moore, 46, both of Milwaukee, were each previously indicted, Carter for two counts of sex trafficking and Moore for sex trafficking, conspiracy and solicitation of a crime of violence. The 15-count indictment returned today charges the two defendants jointly in four additional counts of conspiracy, sex trafficking, and labor trafficking, and charges each defendant with additional sex trafficking offenses, for a total of six additional counts against defendant Carter and eight additional counts against defendant Moore. Both defendants are charged with sex trafficking of both adults and minors. If convicted, Carter and Moore each face a sentence of up to life imprisonment. The case was investigated by the Human Trafficking Task Force for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, which includes law enforcement officers from FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation and the Milwaukee Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Karine Moreno-Taxman of the Eastern District of Wisconsin and Trial Attorney Daniel H. Weiss of the Civil Rights Divisions Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. An indictment is merely an accusation, and each defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
