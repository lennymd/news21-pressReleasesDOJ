  "The Supreme Court today held that there is no substantive due process right to access DNA evidence after a person has been duly convicted. But todays decision is limited: the Court merely spoke about what is constitutional, not what is good policy. And there is a fundamental difference. Constitutional rights are only one part of a fair and full system of justice. Simply because a course of action is constitutional does not make it wise. Nothing in todays decision detracts from the unique power of DNA; indeed, the first line of todays Court opinion emphasized that DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. DNA testing helps ensure that justice is done.  "For that reason, this administration believes that defendants should be permitted access to DNA evidence in a range of circumstances. In the 2004 Innocence Protection Act, Congress guaranteed access to DNA evidence held by the federal government under specific conditions, and made money available to encourage states to do the same. Todays decision reaffirmed the power of such practices, and I hope that in light of todays decision all levels of government will follow the federal governments lead by working to expand access to DNA evidence."
