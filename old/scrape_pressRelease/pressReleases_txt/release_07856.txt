      WASHINGTON  A supervisory customs and border protection officer pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of Florida to impersonating a U.S. Customs attach and making false statements related to his assignment with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Preclearance Office in Dublin, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer for the Southern District of Florida.         Roger J. Kiley, 42, of Miami, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Ursula Mancusi Ungaro in Miami to a criminal information charging him with one count of false personation and one count of making a false statement.          According to court documents, Kiley was stationed at the CBP Preclearance Office in Dublin from 2009 to 2011.  As part of his plea agreement, Kiley admitted that he began a romantic relationship with a Dublin resident in 2010.  Kiley also admitted that he held himself out to this individual as the Customs attach at the U.S. Embassy in Dublin, a government position that did not exist, and that he could arrange for the embassy to lease the residence she was living in as his embassy residence.  Kiley further admitted that he created a fake lease from the embassy as well as a funding cable for the payment of the lease on the residence.  Kiley also admitted that he created a bogus letter from the embassy authorizing the relocation of Kiley and his romantic interest to the United States, and that he forged the signature of the deputy chief of mission on the letter.  Kiley further admitted that he lied to federal agents in February 2012 when interviewed about the allegations of misconduct while he was in Dublin.       Kiley faces up to three years in prison, a $250,000 fine and a year of supervised release for the charge of false personation.  He faces five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release for the false statement charge.  Kiley is also responsible for restitution in the amount of $2,500.   Sentencing has been scheduled for Dec. 7, 2012.        This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Richard B. Evans of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section and Robin W. Waugh, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.  The case is being investigated by the CBP Office of Internal Affairs.
