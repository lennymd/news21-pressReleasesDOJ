NoneThe proposed settlement, if implemented, would mark a major step forward in the safeguarding the right to counsel for both juveniles and adults. Specifically, the settlement would, among other things, require:the representation of children in juvenile court in the circuit to be by a lawyer who specializes in juvenile law and childhood and adolescent development;on notice from the court, a public defender from the juvenile division shall speak to any indigent juvenile who seeks to waive counsel and describe services of counsel available to the juvenile and the benefits of representation;all people, including children, arrested in the circuit and detained in its jails to consult with a lawyer in no more than three business days;the size of the Cordele Circuit Public Defender Office to nearly double, increasing from two full-time assistant public defenders to four, and from one full-time investigator to two; andsignificant and relevant training requirements for public defenders.This settlement recognizes that independent, ethical, and zealous counsel are essential to protecting the due process rights of juveniles, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division will continue to ensure that juveniles across the nation are provided the vital protection of counsel.I am pleased to have played some small part in bringing this matter to a resolution that will benefit the people of the Cordele Judicial Circuit for years to come, said U.S. Attorney Moore. As lawyers, all of us, including the named defendants in this case, understand the importance of providing representation to those who have been charged with a criminal or delinquent act. This agreement puts meat on the bones of that process, and guarantees that individuals who are facing criminal cases in the Cordele Circuit will not only have representation, but truly meaningful representation as they navigate the judicial system. This resolution is good for the accused, it is good for the court system, and it is good for the people of the state of Georgia. I want to thank my friends, Attorney General Sam Olens and Solicitor General Britt Grant, for helping all involved reach a consensus in this matter, and I want to acknowledge the courageous filing on behalf of the plaintiffs that brought this to our attention by Steve Bright.We congratulate the parties on coming together and taking the steps necessary to improve justice for both adults and juveniles in the Cordele Judicial Circuit, said Director Lisa Foster of the Office for Access to Justice. The agreement upholds the core principles of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and represents a model for the rest of Georgia and for the country.NoneIn its statement of interest, the department asserted that children are denied their right to counsel not only when an attorney is entirely absent, but also when an attorney is available in name only. It provided the court with a framework to assess the plaintiffs claim that the defendants are depriving young people accused of delinquency of their right to counsel. As the department summarized in the statement of interest, due process requires that every child who faces the loss of liberty should be represented from their first appearance through, at least, the disposition of their case by an attorney with the training, resources and time to effectively advocate the childs interest. If a child decides to waive the right to an attorney, courts must ensure that the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary by requiring consultation with counsel before the court accepts the waiver.The case was filed in 2014 and brought by indigent adults and juveniles who faced criminal and delinquency charges in the Cordele Judicial Circuit.
