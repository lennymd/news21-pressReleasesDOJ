  WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Mexico against Luna Community College, alleging discrimination against former employee Charlene Ortiz-Cordova in the form of sexual harassment by a supervisor that resulted in a hostile work environment.  "Title VII protects women from discrimination in employment," said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. "The Department of Justice will vigorously pursue cases when employers fail or refuse to take appropriate action to stop sexual harassment in the workplace."  The Departments complaint alleges that the supervisor, Lunas former president, subjected Ms. Ortiz-Cordova to sexual harassment over the course of several months by making unwanted physical contact of a sexual nature, unwanted sexual gestures, and repeated sexually explicit comments to her, among other allegations. The complaint further alleges that Luna failed or refused to take appropriate action to prevent and correct the sexual harassment.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin or religion, and prohibits retaliation against an employee who opposes an unlawful employment practice, or because the employee has made a charge or participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Act.None
