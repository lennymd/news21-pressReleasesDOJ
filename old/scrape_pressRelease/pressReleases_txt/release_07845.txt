Previously, another PMDD Services client, Philip Butcher, formerly of Rogers, Ark., pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false claim for a refund. According to court documents in that case, Butcher filed two tax returns reporting his loans as OID income and tax withholding, claiming tax refunds totaling $1,456,696.        The case was investigated by special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Jonathan Marx and Jed Silversmith of the Justice Department's Tax Division and by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bertha Mitrani of the Southern District of Florida.
