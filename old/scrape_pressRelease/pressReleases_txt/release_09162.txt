None None     Whistleblowers play an important role in protecting taxpayer funds from fraud and abuse, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Civil Division. Settlements like this one help maintain the integrity of FDAs drug approval process and support important federal and state health care programs.      The United States is pleased that Pfizer has agreed to resolve the last of the pending cases that were not settled as part of the 2009 resolution and plea, said Carmen Ortiz, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. We hope and expect that this is indicative of a commitment to move forward in compliance with the law, and we will continue to watch vigilantly to ensure that Pfizer complies with the law in its sales and marketing of drugs sold to the public.  None     This settlement is part of the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and another step for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced by Attorney General Eric Holder and Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in May 2009. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover more than $6.3 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. The Justice Department's total recoveries in False Claims Act cases since January 2009 exceed $8.1 billion.
