Haigler previously pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on Sept. 6, 2013.       According to court documents, between November 2011 and July 2012, Haigler obtained 263 fraudulent U.S. Treasury refund checks and Refund Anticipation Loan checks totaling $606,781. The refund checks were in the names of different individuals and those individuals did not authorize Haigler to cash the checks. Haigler obtained fictitious powers of attorney in the names of the individuals on the checks, which purportedly appointed Haigler to handle financial affairs, including the cashing of checks. Haigler cashed all of the fraudulent refund checks at a store in Millbrook, Ala., and provided the store with copies of the ficticious powers of attorney. Haigler retained a portion of the checks and provided the remainder to the individuals who brought him the fraudulent checks.       This case was investigated by special agents of the IRS - Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Secret Service. Trial Attorneys Michael Boteler and Jason Poole of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Brown prosecuted the case. None
