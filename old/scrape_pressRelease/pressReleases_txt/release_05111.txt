Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Saturday on President Obamas nomination of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to serve as Attorney General:Loretta Lynch is an extraordinarily talented attorney, a dedicated public servant, and a leader of considerable experience and consummate skill. I am certain that she will be an outstanding Attorney General, and I am delighted to join President Obama in congratulating her on this prestigious appointment.Throughout her career, and especially during her tenure as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York  during both the Clinton and Obama Administrations  Loretta has earned the trust and respect of Justice Department employees at every level, in Washington and throughout the country. She is held in high regard by criminal justice, law enforcement, and civil rights leaders of all stripes. And from her time as a career attorney, prosecuting high-profile public corruption cases, to her leadership of sensitive financial fraud and national security investigations, she has proven her unwavering fidelity to the law  and her steadfast dedication to protecting the American people.I have had the good fortune of working closely with Loretta on a range of important issues over the years, and particularly since the beginning of 2013, when I asked her to serve as chair of the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee. She and her colleagues have been instrumental in implementing the Smart on Crime initiative. And I know that she is both well-qualified and uniquely positioned to continue the critical work thats underway and build upon the progress we have made over the past six years, from advancing criminal justice reform to safeguarding civil rights.I am confident that Loretta will lead the Department of Justice with integrity, honor, and distinction. I congratulate her, once again, on her appointment. And I wish her the best of luck.
