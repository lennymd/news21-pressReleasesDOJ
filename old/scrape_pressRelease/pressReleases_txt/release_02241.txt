Changes Include New Code of Professional Responsibility for Practice of Forensic ScienceThe Department of Justice announced new steps today as part of its ongoing commitment to strengthening and advancing forensic science. The department will implement a number of steps that will promote professional responsibility among forensics practitioners, institute best practices and advance the relationship between the academic research of forensic science and implementation in the field.Todays announcement marks yet another step forward in the departments efforts to strengthen the practice of forensic science in our nations laboratories and courtrooms, said Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates. We are continually looking at ways to ensure that forensic evidence is collected, analyzed and presented in a responsible and scientifically rigorous manner.The new policies include adopting a new code of professional responsibility that builds upon existing policies and accreditation requirements for departmental forensic examiners and laboratories. The department believes the code will improve education and guidance on professional responsibility while establishing a process for identifying and addressing violations of professional conduct.Department forensic laboratories will also review their policies and procedures to ensure that forensic examiners are not using the expressions reasonable scientific certainty or reasonable (forensic discipline) certainty in their reports or testimony. Department prosecutors will also abstain from using these expressions when presenting forensic reports or questioning forensic experts in court unless required by a judge or applicable law. This decision complements the departments efforts, announced earlier this year, to provide better guidance to forensic examiners and federal prosecutors on how to properly characterize the strength of forensic evidence in the courtroom.The department also announced policies to implement greater transparency and access to forensic laboratory quality assurance documents and a plan to explore a grant funding of multiyear post-doctoral fellowships at federal, state and local forensic science service providers and forensic medicine service providers.None
