NoneSexual harassment of women is unacceptable and will not be tolerated, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John M. Gore of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. No one should ever have to endure the type of outrageous conduct that occurred in this case in exchange for obtaining or keeping a place to live. NoneNo woman should be subjected to harassment in her own home. This action sends a message to all housing providers that not only is this type of behavior unacceptable and immoral, it is illegal, said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Anna Maria Faras. HUD will continue to work to protect the fair housing rights of victims of harassment. NoneNoneNoneNone
