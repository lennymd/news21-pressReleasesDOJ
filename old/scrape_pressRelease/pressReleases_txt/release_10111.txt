    WASHINGTON -- The Attorney General made the following statement today:     Yesterdays tragic shootings in St. Louis are yet another solemn reminder of the dangers that United States Marshals confront on a daily basis. These brave men and women routinely put their lives on the line in their work to combat crime and gun violence, to apprehend dangerous criminals, and to help bring fugitives to justice. Yesterdays actions by two Deputy U.S. Marshals and local police officers in St. Louis reflect the dedication and courage that defines Americas law enforcement community.     Less than a month after Deputy U.S. Marshal Derek Hotsinpiller was killed in the line of duty in Elkins, West Virginia, our thoughts and prayers now are with the families of Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry, who made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as with Deputy U.S. Marshal Theodore Abegg and the St. Louis police officer who were injured yesterday. Their service, their courage, and their willingness to risk their own lives to protect the safety of others will not be forgotten. As we mourn this devastating loss, we also reaffirm that the Justice Departments commitment to supporting our law enforcement partners  and to ensuring officer safety  will continue to be a top priority.
