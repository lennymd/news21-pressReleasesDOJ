Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement on the resignation of U.S. Attorney Tim Purdon:Tim Purdon has been an outstanding United States Attorney, a fierce advocate for the people of North Dakota and a strong national leader whose efforts to improve public safety in Indian Country have made a profound difference  and touched countless lives, said Attorney General Eric Holder. Throughout his tenure, Tim has distinguished himself as a skilled attorney and a consummate public servant, rising to challenges as diverse as human trafficking, violent crime, drug trafficking and fraud. His work to forge close partnerships with tribal leaders  and to develop and implement an Anti-Violence Strategy for Indian Country  have provided a model for success, increased federal prosecutions on North Dakotas reservations and laid a strong foundation on which future efforts can be built. His exceptional leadership and wise counsel at the national level  advising me and other Justice Department officials as Chair of the Native American Issues Subcommittee  have had an important and enduring impact. And although we are all sorry to see him go, I am proud to join Tims dedicated colleagues in thanking him for his exemplary service as United States Attorney, and wishing him all the best as he begins a new chapter in his career.
