Melot has not filed a personal income tax return since 1986.

According to the indictment and evidence presented at trial, Melot took numerous steps to conceal his ownership of 250 acres in Lea County, N.M., including notarizing forged deeds and titling the property in the name of nominees.  The evidence also showed that Melot used false SSNs and fictitious EINs to hide his assets from the IRS.  Additionally, Melot maintained a bank account with Nordfinanz Zurich, a Swiss financial institution, which he set up in Nassau, Bahamas, in 1992.
