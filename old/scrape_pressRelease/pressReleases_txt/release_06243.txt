None Mr. Morgan has admitted that, as a correctional officer, he  and others  violated a persons constitutional rights and then lied to cover up their on-duty misconduct, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute officers who use their official position to commit and to cover up violations of federal criminal law. Morgan faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Sentencing is set for April 23, 2014, before U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar. In related cases before Judge Bredar, former RCI Correctional Officers Ryan Lohr, Dustin Norris, Philip Mayo, Jeremy McCusker, Walter Steele, Lanny Harris, Keith Morris, Tyson Hinckle and Reginald Martin, and former RCI Lieutenants Robert Harvey and Edwin Stigile each has entered a guilty plea. Two former RCI officers previously entered guilty pleas in state court. Three current or former RCI officers still face federal charges in connection with this incident. These officers are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. The investigation by the Frederick Resident Agency of the FBI is ongoing. The case is being prosecuted by Special Litigation Counsel Forrest Christian and Trial Attorneys Sanjay Patel and Christine Siscaretti of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, with the assistance of Michael Cunningham of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland.
