None  This officer committed a heinous act by raping a woman who called on the police because she needed help. His outrageous conduct requires the significant prison sentence delivered by the court today, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department remains committed to aggressively prosecuting officers who use their authority to violate civil rights.  The 24-year term of imprisonment imposed upon this defendant reflects both the flagrant violation of the fundamental civil rights of a member of our community and the unconscionable conduct of a law enforcement officer sworn to protect our citizens, said James L. Santelle, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The message to all of our constituents, including the police, is that horrific behaviors of this sort will result in prompt investigation, focused prosecution, and prolonged incarceration.  Following an internal investigation, the Milwaukee Police Department fired Cates.

Mody of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.
