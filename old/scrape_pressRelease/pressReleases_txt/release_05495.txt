  Nureni Abayomi Baruwa, a  resident of Alexandria, Virginia, pleaded guilty to employment tax fraud today,  the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.   According to the plea agreement  and statement of facts, Baruwa operated a car detailing business called NAB  International Group of Companies Inc.  This business was incorporated by Baruwa  in 1993 in the commonwealth of Virginia and he served as the president.  Baruwa  was in charge of withholding employment taxes from his employees wages, paying  over the withheld amount to the IRS and reporting these amounts to the IRS by  filing quarterly employment tax returns.   According to court documents,  in all but three quarters, beginning with the first quarter of 2003 through the  last quarter of 2010, Baruwa failed to timely collect, account for and pay the  IRS the taxes withheld from his employees paychecks, as well as the employers  portion of the employment taxes.  Furthermore, in all but five quarters during  the same period, Baruwa failed to file NABs quarterly employment tax returns  with the IRS in a timely manner.  Additionally, since at least 2006, Baruwa has  failed to file an individual income tax return in a timely manner, despite the  fact that he was legally required to do so annually.  According to court  documents, the tax loss is between $200,000 and $400,000, which will be  determined by the court at Baruwas Oct. 24 sentencing.   This case was investigated by  special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by  Assistant Chief Caryn Finley of the departments Tax Division and Assistant U.S.  Attorney Uzo Asonye for the Eastern District of Virginia.
