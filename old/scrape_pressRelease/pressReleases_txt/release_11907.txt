  WASHINGTON    The Justice Department announced today defendant Paul Raymond Green was sentenced late last week to 52 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his role in a scheme to prostitute minor females.  Green, 23, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Green admitted that he, through his co-conspirator, arranged on two separate occasions in 2007 to provide minor victims to an acquaintance who paid to have sex with the victims. On both occasions, cigarettes dipped in phencyclidine liquid known as PCP, called "dippers" or "wets," were available in the hotel room where the girls were brought to have sex. Green also sold cocaine to that same individual.  "The defendant in this case took an active role in prostituting young girls, violating their civil rights in order to facilitate his drug sales," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "This type of crime is beyond despicable, and the Justice Department remains committed to prosecuting such cases."  "Anyone who pays for or profits from sex with a child should be on notice that Maryland's human trafficking task force is committed to a policy of zero tolerance for child prostitution," said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein for the District of Maryland.  Acting Assistant Attorney General King and U.S. Attorney Rosenstein commend the FBI and the Montgomery County Police Department for their work in this cooperative investigation and prosecution. Assistant U.S. Attorney Solette Magnelli and Civil Rights Division Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit attorney Jim Felte are prosecuting this case for the Government.None
