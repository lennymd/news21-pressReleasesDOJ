      Dr. Michael N. Mangold pleaded guilty to tax evasion and making false statements today in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, announced the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Mangold was indicted in October 2012.        According to court documents, Mangold was a medical doctor specializing in emergency medicine and urgent care who, since 1993, had worked as a physician for various hospitals, emergency rooms and urgent care facilities. At times, he also worked as a physician in state and county correctional facilities. Mangold primarily earned income through a combination of employee wages and independent contractor payments.        In his plea agreement, Mangold admitted that from 1997 through 2007, he willfully concealed his income by filing false tax returns and making frivolous legal arguments to the IRS with regard to his overall tax liabilities. Mangold further admitted that he made false statements to the civil and criminal-side of the IRS during the investigation. In total, Mangold owed the IRS approximately $191,577 in taxes based on his income and wages during the relevant calendar years, plus interest.       Mangold also admitted that he made materially false statements in the course of a civil lawsuit concerning his failure to repay federal loan obligations by submitting a false financial affidavit to government officials, which contained false statements about the amount of income he earned as a doctor.        As a result of his plea, Mangold faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $350,000 fine.       This case was investigated by special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Charles M. Edgar Jr. and Rebecca Perlmutter of the Justice Departments Tax Division are prosecuting the case.
