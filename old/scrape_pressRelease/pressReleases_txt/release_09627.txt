  WASHINGTON  The United States has sued a Seattle-area man to stop him from promoting an alleged tax fraud scheme, the Justice Department announced today.   The governments civil injunction complaint alleges that John Lloyd Kirk promotes the use of fabricated Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms 1099-OID to report fictitious income tax withholding.   Kirks customers allegedly file federal tax returns claiming huge tax refunds based on the fake withholding.   According to the complaint, Kirk, who resides in Des Moines, Wash., promotes the scheme through his business, the Indian Nations Advocate Law Office.   Kirk allegedly holds seminars in the western United States and sells DVDs of his seminars to promote the tax scam.   The complaint states that at least 31 of Kirks customers have used the scheme to make fraudulent tax refund claims totaling approximately $8 million. None
