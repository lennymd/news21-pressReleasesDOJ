Today, the Department of Justice provided an update on the ten jurisdictions identified in a May 2016 report by the Departments Inspector General as having policies that potentially violate 8 U.S.C. 1373. Each of the ten jurisdictions were required to submit their legal analysis of how they are in compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373 by June 30, 2017. The Justice Department received alleged compliance information from each of the ten jurisdictions by the deadline, is in the process of reviewing them, and looks forward to making a determination as to whether those jurisdictions are in compliance with federal law. Some of these jurisdictions have boldly asserted they will not comply with requests from federal immigration authorities, and this would potentially violate 8 U.S.C. 1373.  It is not enough to assert compliance, the jurisdictions must actually be in compliance, Attorney General Sessions said. "Sanctuary cities put the lives and well-being of their residents at risk by shielding criminal illegal aliens from federal immigration authorities. These policies give sanctuary to criminals, not to law-abiding Americans. The Trump Administration is determined to keep every American neighborhood safe and that is why we have asked these cities to comply with federal law, specifically 8 U.S.C. 1373. The Department of Justice has now received letters from ten jurisdictions across the United States claiming that they are in compliance with what federal law requires of them, and we will examine these claims carefully. Residents have a right to expect basic compliance with federal law from their local and state governments."
