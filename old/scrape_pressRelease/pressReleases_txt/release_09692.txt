      WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice today released an updated version of the Antitrust Divisions Policy Guide to Merger Remedies. The policy guide is a tool for Antitrust Division staff to use in analyzing proposed remedies in its merger matters. It also provides transparency into the divisions approach to merger remedies for the business community, the antitrust bar and the broader public.

The updated policy guide also reflects the changes in the merger landscape and the lessons the division has learned from the remedies it has entered into since the issuance of the original guide in 2004, ensuring that it accurately details the divisions merger remedy practices.       The policy guide states that effective merger remedies typically include structural or conduct provisions, or a combination. In horizontal merger matters, the division continues to rely predominantly on structural remedies, sometimes in combination with conduct remedies. However, the division has found that in many vertical transactions tailored conduct relief can prevent competitive harm while allowing the mergers efficiencies to be realized.        The key principles the Antitrust Division applies in analyzing merger remedies remain the same: None
