  WASHINGTON    A federal judge in Providence, R.I., entered a preliminary injunction against Michael Brier, individually, and doing business as Refunds Now Inc., RNTS Inc., FTIRS Inc., POTIRS Inc. and IHIRS Inc. from preparing federal tax returns for others. Also enjoined are Jeffrey Sroufe, Refunds Nows director of operations and Esther Santiago, RNTSs president.  The court found that at least 300 returns prepared by Brier and Refunds Now understated customers tax liabilities. It further found that Brier and his employees fabricated deductions and tax credits on the returns, for which they had no support. The court noted that with respect to one of Briers customers, a Refunds Now employee offered to provide the customer with fake receipts in order to substantiate amounts reported on her federal tax return.None
