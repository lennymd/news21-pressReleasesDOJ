Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Monday after he and Acting Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates met with representatives from the Coalition for Public Safety, a bipartisan organization dedicated to pursuing reform of the nations criminal justice system:In our ongoing effort to reform our criminal justice system, the formation of a coalition this ideologically diverse represents an important milestone unto itself. Though different concerns may bring us to the table  whether it be the skyrocketing costs of incarceration, or the unfair disparities seen in our prison population  the important thing is the broad consensus in favor of action on this issue. The Justice Department has made real gains in reforming our sentencing policies and reducing the federal prison population, but more work remains to be done. Even at a time of gridlock in Washington, I am actually quite optimistic that criminal justice reform is one issue around which we can unite and make a true difference.None
