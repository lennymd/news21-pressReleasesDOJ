Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the following statement on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Decision: President Trumps executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the Nation safe. The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the decision of the divided court, which blocks the Presidents efforts to strengthen this countrys national security. As the dissenting judges explained, the executive order is a constitutional exercise of the Presidents duty to protect our communities from terrorism. The President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States. This Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the power and duty of the Executive Branch to protect the people of this country from danger, and will seek review of this case in the United States Supreme Court.
