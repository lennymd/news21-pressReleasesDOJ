According to a civil complaint the United States filed in 2014, a Chicago-based tax return preparer prepared returns that falsely claimed that recipients of discrimination awards related to a class-action lawsuit could claim large deductions on their federal tax returns and that falsely inflated the amount of wages that city of Chicago employees claimed were withheld from their paychecks.
