The United States has sued Charles Sewell of Bristol, Va., to bar him from promoting an alleged scheme involving fraudulent tax refund claims, the Justice Department announced today.According to the governments amended complaint, Sewell creates fraudulent types of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms 1099 for other taxpayers and files them with the IRS. The fraudulent types of Forms 1099 are allegedly designed to help Sewells customers request large tax refunds to which they are not entitled, based on false claims of income earned and federal tax withheld. The complaint alleges that Sewells scheme is based on the commercial redemption theory, in which individuals make refund claims based on the bogus theory that the federal government maintains secret accounts for U.S. citizens and that taxpayers can gain access to the accounts by issuing 1099-OID forms to the IRS. The lawsuit alleges that Sewells customers sought $67 million in bogus refunds as a result of Sewells conduct.NoneRelated Documents:United States v. Charles Sewell, et al.None
