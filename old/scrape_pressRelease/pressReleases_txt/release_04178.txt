The United States filed a complaint seeking to bar a Newberry County, South Carolina, woman from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil complaint against Julie E. Hueble, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleges that Hueble owned and operated three Liberty Tax Service franchise locations in Greenwood and Clinton, South Carolina. According to the complaint, Hueble and the employees of her tax preparation stores prepared federal income tax returns that improperly understated customers tax liabilities or increased customers claims for refundable tax credits.The complaint alleges that Hueble and her employees prepared returns for customers that, among other things, falsely reported on Schedule Cs (Profit or Loss From Business) non-existent businesses and/or inflated income or deductions. The suit further alleges that Hueble and her employees fabricated other deductions, claimed improper filing statuses and falsely claimed dependents, all of which resulted in fraudulently maximizing refunds and/or refundable credits.In one example detailed in the complaint, Hueble falsely increased a customers taxable income by reporting a fabricated childcare business, even though the customer did not own a child care business and gave Hueble no documentation showing that she did. The increased income enabled the customer to receive an inflated Earned Income Tax Credit.The complaint states that Huebles tax-preparation stores prepared 2,165 federal income tax returns between 2012 and 2014, and Hueble prepared 904 returns during this period. An analysis of returns filed between 2012 and 2014 revealed that the harm to the U.S. Treasury caused by Huebles conduct could be more than $1 million, according to the suit.None
