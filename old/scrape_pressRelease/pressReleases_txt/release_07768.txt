According to the indictment, from January 2011 through November 2011, Blackmon participated in a scheme to file false tax returns using stolen identities.

If convicted, Blackmon faces a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the two wire fraud counts, 10 years for the access device fraud count, 5 years for the misuse of a Social Security number count, and a mandatory 2-year sentence for the aggravated identity theft counts.
