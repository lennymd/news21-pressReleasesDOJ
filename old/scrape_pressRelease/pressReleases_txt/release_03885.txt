The Department of Justice and the Department of Commerces National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) today announced six appointments to the National Commission on Forensic Science.The commission, created in 2013, develops forward-looking policy recommendations for the Attorney General to enhance the practice and improve the reliability of forensic science.The commission is co-chaired by Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Dr. Willie E. May. Deputy Assistant Administrator Nelson Santos of the Drug Enforcement Administrations Office of Forensic Sciences and Special Assistant John M. Butler to the NIST Director for Forensic Science serve as vice-chairs.For nearly two years, the commission has been hard at work developing recommendations to strengthen the field of forensic science and the six new commissioners will bring valuable new insights to this process, said Deputy Attorney General Yates. Their work is vital to ensuring the fairness of our criminal justice system.Confidence in the collection, review and analysis of evidence by law enforcement and in the ability of the courts to fairly judge the strength of that evidence is the bedrock of any civil society, said Under Secretary May. The new commissioners represent a diverse range of skills and training and we look forward to their contributions as we continue our efforts to ensure that the forensic evidence used in our criminal justice system is supported by rigorous science, measurements and analysis.The commission includes federal, state and local forensic science service providers; research scientists and academics; law enforcement officials; prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges; and other stakeholders from across the country. This breadth of experience and expertise reflects the many different entities that contribute to forensic science practice in the United States and will ensure that these broad perspectives are represented on the commission and in its work.The commission was established in 2013 and re-chartered for another two-year period in April 2015. The new members announced today are replacing individuals whose tenures with the commission recently ended. Because the re-charter includes a provision for digital evidence, an additional commissioner has been added to provide perspective in this important area of forensic science.The new commissioners are:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
