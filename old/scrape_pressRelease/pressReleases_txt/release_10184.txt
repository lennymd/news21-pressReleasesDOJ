  WASHINGTON  An Arkansas woman who operates Fosters Income Tax Service in Knobel, Ark., has been permanently barred from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The injunction order against Betty J. Foster, to which she consented, was entered by Judge J. Leon Holmes of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  The governments complaint alleges that Foster, through her company, prepares federal income tax returns for her customers that claim losses for non-existent businesses, as well as inflated or fabricated deductions, in order to understate tax liabilities unlawfully. According to the complaint, Foster has been preparing tax returns for a fee for approximately 25 years, and she consistently prepares approximately 450 tax returns per year. The government estimates that Fosters unlawful return preparation activity has cost the United States $5 million or more for the 2007 through 2009 tax years.None
