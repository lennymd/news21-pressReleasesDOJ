In this age of increased collection and distribution of consumer information, aggressive enforcement of the FCRA ensures that these reports contain facts, not mistakes. Along with the $2.6 million civil penalty, HireRight agreed to injunctions against future FCRA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act violations in a proposed consent decree filed with the complaint. The consent decree also requires HireRight to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of reports and, upon request, to provide consumers the information in their files, such as criminal history reports. Access to these reports ensures that the consumers can dispute erroneous criminal history information that would substantially interfere with their ability to obtain a job. None None
