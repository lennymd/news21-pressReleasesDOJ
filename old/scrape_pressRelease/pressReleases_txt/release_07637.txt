None       This agreement will significantly reduce the amount of air pollution, known to cause a variety of environmental and health problems, from the nations largest manufacturer of glass containers, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice. The settlement, the latest in a series of agreements with the glass manufacturing sector, addresses major sources of pollution at facilities located in four states and will mean cleaner air for the people living in those communities.       The pollution controls required by todays settlement will significantly reduce emissions that can impact residents health and local environment in communities located near glass manufacturing plants, said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for the EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. These new pollution controls will improve air quality and protect communities from Georgia to Texas from emissions that can lead to respiratory illnesses, smog and acid rain.
