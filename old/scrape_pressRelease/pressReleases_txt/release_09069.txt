      MONTGOMERY, Ala.  Marsha Elmore of Wetumpka, Ala., the owner of a tax preparation business called Community Tax, pleaded guilty today to charges related to her use of stolen identities to fraudulently obtain tax refunds, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced. Elmore pleaded guilty to one count each of filing a false claim, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. On Aug. 31, 2011, she had been charged with those crimes as part of a 32-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Montgomery, Ala.        According to her plea agreement and other court documents, Elmores fraudulent activity ran from 2009 until July 2011, when she was arrested by the IRS on a criminal complaint.

Altogether, Community Tax and Elmore were linked to almost 1,400 tax returns during this time period. In her plea agreement, Elmore admitted that she personally filed many false returns through Community Tax.        Sentencing has not yet been scheduled. Elmore faces a minimum of two years and up to 27 years in prison, as well as up to three years of supervised release, mandatory restitution and a fine of up to $750,000 or twice the loss caused by her offenses.        The case was investigated by Special Agents of the IRS - Criminal Investigation. Trial attorneys Jason H.
