Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on the planned departure of U.S. Attorney David Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania:For the last six years, U.S. Attorney David Hickton has served the people of the Western District of Pennsylvania  and all the American people  with fidelity, integrity and distinction. Under Davids outstanding leadership, his office has been at the forefront of some of the Justice Departments most consequential achievements of the last few years. These include the indictment of five Chinese military hackers for committing cyber espionage, the dismantling of the Darkode hacking forum and the first human trafficking cases to be brought in the Western District of Pennsylvania. In addition, David has been a tireless advocate of stronger community-police relations and he has been a crucial partner in the fight against the devastating heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. There is no doubt that the United States is a stronger and safer place because of Davids many contributions. I thank him for his distinguished service, and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
