The Department of Justice has reached an agreement with the St. James Parish School District in Louisiana that upon completion will end court supervision of the districts schools.The consent order, approved yesterday by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, addresses all remaining issues in the school desegregation case, and when fully implemented will lead to the closing of that case.The consent order, negotiated with the school district and private plaintiffs, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, puts the district on a path to full unitary status within three years provided it:The consent order declares that the district has already met its desegregation obligations in the area of transportation. The court will retain jurisdiction over the consent order during its implementation, and the Justice Department will monitor the districts compliance.We are pleased to have worked hand-in-hand with the schools to ensure equal and fair treatment for the students of the St. James Parish School District, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division.We look forward to working with the district and private plaintiffs to implement the consent order and bring this case to a successful close.NoneNone
