The Department of Justices Antitrust Division sent a letter to the Kansas Real Estate Commission expressing its concerns regarding K.A.R. 86-3-32, a proposed regulation that would bar Kansas real estate brokers from offering gift cards to home buyers. According to the Division, this regulation would reduce competition and the likely effect would be to harm home buyers in Kansas. A copy of the Divisions June 16, 2017, letter is attached.
