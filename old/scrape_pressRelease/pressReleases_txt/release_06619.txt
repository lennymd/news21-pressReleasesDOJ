NoneNone  EPA regulations issued under Title VI of the CAA require that owner or operators of commercial refrigeration equipment that contains over 50 pounds of ozone-depleting refrigerants, and that has an annual leak rate greater than 35 percent repair such leaks within 30 days.  HCFCs deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, which allows dangerous amounts of cancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the sun to strike the earth, leading to adverse health effects that include skin cancers, cataracts, and suppressed immune systems. Pursuant to the Montreal Protocol, the United States is implementing strict reductions of ozone-depleting refrigerants, including a production and importation ban by 2020 of HCFC-22, a common refrigerant used by supermarkets.  The settlement is part of EPAs national enforcement initiative to control harmful air pollution from the largest sources of emissions, including large grocery stores.  Corporate commitments to reduce emissions from refrigeration systems have been increasing in recent years. EPAs GreenChill Partnership Program works with food retailers to reduce refrigerant emissions and decrease their impact on the ozone layer and climate change by transitioning to environmentally friendlier refrigerants, using less refrigerant and eliminating leaks, and adopting green refrigeration technologies and best environmental practices.None  For more information: http://www2.epa.gov/enforcement/safeway-inc-clean-air-act-settlement.
