  A federal court has permanently enjoined Reinhold Sommerstedt, a Las Vegas-based promoter of a sham trust tax scam. According to papers filed in the case, Sommerstedt created phony domestic and foreign trusts to move customers assets from the United States to offshore banks located in the West Indies. Customers allegedly used phony loans and gifts to repatriate their money while concealing it from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Customers paid as much as $14,500 to participate in the scheme.  In granting the injunction, Judge Brian E. Sandoval of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada said that Sommerstedt failed to present "any evidence to refute the government's indication that Sommerstedt's trust scheme was organized and operated solely for the purpose of improperly reducing his customers' federal tax liabilities." The injunction bars Sommerstedt from promoting the trust scheme or any similar scheme. He must also give the government a list of his customers names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers.NoneNone  Lynn Lakers of Boulder City, Nev., a tax-return preparer who allegedly prepared false tax returns for the phony trusts used in the scheme; and Stephen Nestor of Boise, Idaho, a former IRS revenue officer who allegedly signed false tax returns on behalf of customers bogus trusts.None  John DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked Robert Metcalfe, the Justice Department trial attorney who handled the case.
