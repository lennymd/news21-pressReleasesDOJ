None   Naaman and his companies were the Iraqi agents of Innospec Inc.   On March 18, 2010, Innospec pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment charging wire fraud in connection with its payment of kickbacks to the Iraqi government under the OFFP, as well as FCPA violations in connection with bribe payments it made to officials in the Iraqi Ministry of Oil.    None None   In addition to bribes actually offered and paid to Iraqi officials, Naaman convinced Innospec to pay him $750,000 for additional bribes that Naaman never paid, instead keeping the money for himself.      Naaman separately settled civil charges on Aug. 5, 2010, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the same misconduct.   Naaman disgorged $877,096 in profits and prejudgment interest in connection with the settlement.   The SEC civil penalty of $438,038 will be satisfied in part by his criminal fine.   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Kathleen M. Hamann and Assistant Chief Nathaniel B. Edmonds of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.   The case was investigated by the dedicated FCPA squad at FBIs Washington Field Office and the Counter Proliferation Investigations Unit of the Washington Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   Significant assistance was provided by the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs and the SECs FCPA Unit.   The Innospec matter has been investigated with assistance from the SEC and in cooperation with the Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United Kingdoms Serious Fraud Office.
