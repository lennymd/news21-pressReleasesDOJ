A Texas federal court permanently barred Melissa Alvarez, a tax preparer in McAllen, Texas, from preparing returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Alvarez agreed to the permanent ban, and the court entered an order imposing a permanent injunction against Alvarez on Oct. 27.The order also requires Alvarez to turn over to the government a list of all customers for whom she prepared federal tax returns or claims for a refund for tax years 2011 through 2013, and to notify her customers for tax year 2013 of the permanent injunction against her. The order authorizes the government to monitor Alvarezs compliance with the terms of the order.The complaint alleged that Alvarez prepared returns that contained false, improper or inflated deductions or tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit. The complaint also alleged that these activities caused Alvarezs customers to file returns which unlawfully understated income and tax liabilities and overstated refunds.None
