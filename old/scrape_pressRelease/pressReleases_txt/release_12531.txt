  WASHINGTON  The President released the Administrations FY2010 top-line budget proposal today which includes $26.5 billion for the Department of Justice (DOJ), a 3.5 percent increase more than the FY 2009 budget. The Departments budget includes enhanced funding for: national security and intelligence; combating financial fraud; hiring additional police officers; civil rights enforcement; securing our nations borders; and for federal detention and incarceration programs.  "The President has promised that, from the day he took office, America will have a Justice Department that is truly dedicated to justice," said Attorney General Holder. "This budget supports this vital task by investing in our critical law enforcement mission, including protecting Americans from terrorism, fighting financial and mortgage fraud, getting more cops on the beat, reinvigorating civil rights enforcement, and providing essential resources for our prisons."NoneNone NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone  Due to the Presidential transition, the President is releasing the FY 2010 budget request in two parts. The first submission, today, provides the top-line request for each agency, including the Department of Justice. The second submission, in April, will consist of detailed budget proposals and traditional congressional justification materials. The details of the Department of Justice FY 2010 budget request will be finalized in the coming weeks, and the Administrations proposals will be released in April.  Todays top-line budget proposal builds upon the recent funding the Department received as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R.1). The Department received $4 billion in grant funding to enhance state, local and tribal law enforcement efforts, including the hiring of new police officers, to combat violence against women, and to fight Internet crimes against children.
