NoneEvery day, the Justice Departments federal prosecutors and trial attorneys work hard to protect our citizens, to safeguard precious taxpayer resources, and to provide a valuable return on investment to the American people, said Attorney General Holder. Their diligent efforts are enabling us to achieve justice and recoup losses in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy. And it shows the fruits of the Justice Departments tireless work in enforcing federal laws; in protecting the American people from violent crime, national security threats, discrimination, exploitation, and abuse; and in holding financial institutions accountable for their roles in causing the 2008 financial crisis.The amount is more than three times the $8 billion collected in FY 2013. The largest civil collections were from affirmative civil enforcement cases, many of which were brought under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, in which the United States recovered government money lost to fraud or other misconduct or collected from individuals and/or corporations for violations of federal health, safety, civil rights, tax, or environmental laws. In addition, civil debts were collected on behalf of several federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Internal Revenue Service, Small Business Administration and Department of Education.The total includes all monies collected as a result of Justice Department-led enforcement actions and negotiated civil settlements. It includes approximately $13.7 billion in payments made directly to the Justice Department, and $11 billion in indirect payments made to other federal agencies, states and other designated recipients.In measuring collections recovered in FY 2014, this figure necessarily includes some cases that were resolved in previous years but the proceeds of which were collected in FY 2014.NoneNoneNoneNone
