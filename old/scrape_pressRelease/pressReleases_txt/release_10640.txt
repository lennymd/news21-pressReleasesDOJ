      WASHINGTON, D.C.  Speaking at the European Offenders Employment Forum today, Attorney General Eric Holder announced $110 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 funding for the Second Chance Act reentry grants and the Justice Reinvestment Initiative. These two efforts focus on reducing recidivism rates and state and local spending on corrections through the use of evidence-based, smart-on-crime approaches implemented by state, local, tribal and non-profit partners.   The departments Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is administering the grants, research, and training and technical assistance.     Todays Department of Justice is dedicated to being smart, not only tough, on crime  and our reentry efforts are no exception, said Attorney General Holder. Its vital that we help ensure that people who want to improve our society, as well as their own circumstances, have opportunities to grow, to learn, and to contribute. By joining together, I believe that we can realize our shared vision of safe, thriving communities.     According to OJPs Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are more than 2.3 million people incarcerated in the United States.  Ninety-five percent of all people incarcerated today will eventually be released and will return to their communities. The conference, Oct. 7-8 in Washington, D.C., was convened by the National Transitional Jobs Network and the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion to discuss promising practices, policies, and strategies for prisoner reentry.
