A Norfolk, Virginia, man pleaded guilty today to operating an odometer fraud scheme involving more than 50 vehicles, the Department of Justice announced.  Lawson W. Basnight, 48, pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of Virginia to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and odometer tampering.  Basnight pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas E. Miller. Sentencing is set for May 16.  When consumers purchase a vehicle, they rely on recorded mileage totals in assessing a vehicles cost, condition, and reliability for passenger safety, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Departments Civil Division. The Department of Justice will continue to work diligently to prosecute individuals who use altered odometers and phony titles to defraud consumers. None Trial Attorneys Jacqueline Blaesi-Freed and John W. Burke of the Civil Divisions Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting this case with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Yusi of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
