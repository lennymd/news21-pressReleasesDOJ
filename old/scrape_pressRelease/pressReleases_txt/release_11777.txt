None    The company will spend more than an estimated $250,000 to retrofit one refrigeration unit that currently uses such chemicals, replacing them with environmentally-friendly alternatives, and will either retrofit or retire two other units. BASF will also pay a civil penalty of $384,200 to resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations.  Under the settlement, BASF will replace one industrial refrigeration unit at its facility in Beaumont, and will either retrofit or retire two others at that facility. All of those units currently use hydro-chlorofluorocarbons, known as "HCFCs," which destroy stratospheric, or "good" ozone. All replacement units will be able to use only non ozone-depleting refrigerants. BASF has already replaced or retired four other refrigeration units at BASFs facilities in Livonia, Mich.; Greenville, Ohio; and South Brunswick, N.J., at a cost of over $200,000. Combined, the measures that the company is performing will remove approximately 4,760 pounds of harmful HCFCs from their operations.  "Todays settlement demonstrates this administrations commitment to achieve the benefits envisioned by the Clean Air Act," said John C. Cruden, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division. "We are pleased that after violating important ozone protection requirements, BASF is now committed to a settlement that will bring the company into compliance with the Acts requirements."  "Todays settlement marks an important step in protecting the earths stratospheric ozone layer from the harmful effects on HCFCs," said EPA Acting Regional Administrator Lawrence E. Starfield. "EPA will continue to enforce against companies that violate the rules."None   BASF Corporation, headquartered in Florham, N.J., is the U.S. affiliate of BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany. The company makes a wide variety of products, including chemicals, plastics, and agricultural products at the five plants included in the agreement.
