A federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, has permanently barred Tarralis K. Mack, individually and doing business as Metro Tax Advisors, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Mack previously pleaded guilty to willfully aiding or assisting in, or procuring counseling, or advising the preparation or presentation of a false or fraudulent amended income tax return.  The civil injunction order, to which the defendant consented, was signed by Judge William S. Duffey, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.  According to the complaint, Mack prepared federal income tax returns for customers that generated fraudulent refunds by creating fictitious business expenses to offset wage income. The complaint alleges that none of these customers owned any businesses and Mack did not request information to substantiate the business income and expenses he claimed on the customers returns. The returns prepared by Mack and audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claimed a total of $481,302 in fraudulent refunds, according to the complaint.  None
