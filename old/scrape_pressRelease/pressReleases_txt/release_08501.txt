  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced today that the Civil Rights Division will monitor the election on April 3, 2012, in Milwaukee. The monitoring will ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other federal voting rights statutes. The Voting Rights Act prohibits discrimination in the election process on the basis of race, color or membership in a minority language group. In addition, the act requires certain covered jurisdictions to provide language assistance during the election process. The city of Milwaukee is required to provide assistance in Spanish.  Justice Department personnel will monitor polling place activities in Milwaukee. Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.  Each year, the Justice Department deploys hundreds of federal observers from the Office of Personnel Management, as well as departmental staff, to monitor elections across the country. To file complaints about discriminatory voting practices, including acts of harassment or intimidation, voters may call the Voting Section of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division at 1-800-253-3931.None
