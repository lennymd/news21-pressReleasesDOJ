  WASHINGTON  Regency Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers Inc. nursing home chain will pay the United States $4 million to settle allegations that Regency submitted false claims to Medicare and the Texas Medicaid program, the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Texas announced today. The Victoria, Texas-based chain currently owns and operates 24 nursing home facilities located through the state.  The False Claims Act settlement resolves allegations that Regency submitted claims for reimbursement to Medicare and Medicaid for rehabilitation and skilled nursing services that were not reimbursable because the nursing home residents were not qualified for the services, the services were not medically necessary, or they were not supported by adequate documentation.  "Nursing home providers participating in Medicare should be on notice that taxpayers will not absorb the costs of improper or false billings submitted to the government and that the Department of Justice will take action against them for submitting such claims," said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Departments Civil Division.  "With the number of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries increasing every year, we will take whatever action is necessary to make certain healthcare providers are reimbursed only for legitimate services provided to qualified beneficiaries," said Tim Johnson, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.  The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Office of Inspector General; and was handled by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Texas and the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.
