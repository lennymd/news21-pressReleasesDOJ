The Justice Department announced today that it has terminated its January 2012 settlement agreement with the Mercer County, West Virginia, School District following the districts successful implementation of programs and services for its English Learner (EL) students, as required by the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA) of 1974.After entering into the settlement agreement, the district implemented a process whereby every new student completed a home language survey so that all students with non-English speaking backgrounds were timely identified; had their English proficiency assessed; and if they were not proficient, were provided with individualized English language services and supports. The district also implemented a new curriculum for the instruction of EL students, improved its teacher training, carefully monitored the academic progress of current and former EL students and enhanced its communications with limited-English proficient families.As a result of its efforts, the district has successfully integrated dozens of EL students into its student body, enabling them to access the curriculum and develop strong relationships with their teachers and peers. EL students and their parents have credited the districts individualized programs and the dedication of EL teachers in furthering the students progress.We commend the Mercer County School District for successfully implementing the settlement agreement and for showing dedication and care to its English Learner students and their families, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We hope other rural districts with growing EL populations will learn from Mercer Countys positive example and significant progress.None
