      The United States has filed a complaint against a Virginia-based contractor alleging that the company submitted false claims for unqualified security guards under a contract to provide security in Iraq, the Justice Department announced today.  The company, Triple Canopy Inc. is headquartered in Reston, Va.       In June 2009, the Joint Contracting Command in Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) awarded Triple Canopy a one-year, $10 million contract to perform a variety of security services at Al Asad Airbase  the second largest air base in Iraq.  The multi-national JCC-I/A was established by U.S. Central Command in November 2004, to provide contracting support related to the governments relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq.     None       For a government contractor to knowingly provide deficient security services, as is alleged in this case, is unthinkable, especially in war time, said Stuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.  The department will do everything it can to ensure that contractors comply with critical contract requirements and that contractors who dont comply arent permitted to profit at the expense of our men and women in uniform and the taxpayers at home who support them.        We will not tolerate government contractors anywhere in the world who seek to defraud the United States through deliberate or reckless conduct that violates contractual requirements and risks the security of government personnel, said Neil H. MacBride, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. None       This matter was investigated by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia; the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Departments Civil Division; and the Army Criminal Investigative Command (CID) and Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) of the Department of Defense.       The claims asserted against Triple Canopy are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.  The government is not aware of any injuries that occurred as a result of the alleged misconduct. None
