      Matthew Bender, a paid preparer of tax returns residing in Detroit, was charged in a superseding indictment with preparing false tax returns and tax obstruction, the Justice Department, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) announced today.      Bender had been arrested on a portion of those charges on January 10, 2013. The superseding indictment charges Bender with 16 counts of assisting in the presentation of false tax returns to the IRS along with one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws.       According to the superseding indictment, between 2004 and 2012, Bender prepared returns for taxpayers that falsely claimed refunds and contained false deductions and tax withholdings. The superseding indictment also alleges that Bender filed false tax returns for himself for 2007 and 2009 and failed to file his own tax returns for 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011.        An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the defendant faces a potential maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.       This case was investigated by special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation and TIGTA and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Jeffrey McLellan and Kenneth Vert of the Justice Departments Tax Division.
