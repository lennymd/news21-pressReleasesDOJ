      WASHINGTON - An Iowa ready-mix concrete company pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy for the sales of ready-mix concrete, the Department of Justice announced today.         According to a one-count felony charge filed on June 10, 2011, in U.S. District Court in Sioux City, Iowa, Tri-State Ready Mix Inc., a producer of ready-mix concrete headquartered in Rock Valley, Iowa, participated in a conspiracy with GCC Alliance Concrete Inc. and its predecessor entity to fix prices for ready-mix concrete sold in the northern district of Iowa.  The department said that the conspiracy took place beginning at least as early as January 2006 and continuing until as late as August 2009.         Ready-mix concrete is a product comprised of cement, aggregate (sand and gravel), water and other additives.  The concrete generally is produced in a concrete plant and is transported by concrete-mixer trucks to work sites, where it is used in various types of construction projects, including buildings and roads.   None      Tri-State Ready Mix is charged with violating the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $100 million for corporations.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.
