Former Des Moines, Iowa, Police Department Officer Colin J. Boone, 39, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern District of Iowa to serve 63 months in federal prison for using unreasonable force during a 2013 arrest, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division and U. S. Attorney Nicholas A. Klinefeldt of the Southern District of Iowa.This case arose from Boone's use of excessive force against Orville Hill during Hills arrest on Feb. 19, 2013. During the incident, Boone arrived at a scene where three fellow Des Moines police officers were holding Hill on the ground and a fourth officer was standing over the group. Boone ran up to the group and kicked Hill in the face, knocking out two of Hills teeth and breaking his nose. Other officers reported Boones conduct to supervisors after learning that Boone had submitted a written report in which he failed to account truthfully for his actions. On March 13, 2015, a jury found Boone guilty of violating Hills civil rights by using unreasonable force.As this sentences makes clear, there are serious consequences when law enforcement officers betray the trust of their community by violating the rights of individuals, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta. The Department of Justice stands ready to hold accountable those who violate the civil rights laws.This investigation was conducted by the FBI, and was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Bobbi Bernstein of the Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Mahoney of the Southern District of Iowa.
