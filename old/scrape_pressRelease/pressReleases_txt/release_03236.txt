A federal court has permanently barred a Colorado man and his tax preparation business from preparing federal tax returns, the Justice Department announced today. The United States filed a civil complaint against Gerardo Herrera and his business, El Lobo Multiservicios Professionales Inc., contending that they fraudulently reduced their customers tax liabilities by reporting extra dependents and claiming bogus deductions. After the defendants failed to respond to the complaint, on Jan. 7, 2016, Judge John L. Kane entered an order permanently banning Herrera from preparing returns.According to the governments civil complaint, Herrera and his staff repeatedly claimed their customers extended family members as dependents, even though they do not qualify for dependent status under federal law, and have improperly claimed deductions for personal expenses like cell phones and car insurance. In addition, according to the complaint, audits have shown that Herrera and his workers exaggerated deductions, reported fraudulent charitable contribution deductions and claimed improper head of household filing status. The complaint alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited more than 200 returns prepared by Herreras business and found misrepresentations on more than 99 percent of them.None
