None         The indictment, filed today in the U.S. District Court in San Juan, charges Farmer, the former vice president of price and yield management of Crowley, with conspiring with co-conspirators to suppress and eliminate competition by agreeing to fix rates and surcharges for Puerto Rico freight services from at least as early as mid-2005 until at least April 2008.           Crowley transports a variety of cargo shipments, such as heavy equipment, perishable food items, medicines and consumer goods, on scheduled ocean voyages between the continental United States and Puerto Rico.         The indictment alleges, among other things, that Farmer and co-conspirators carried out the conspiracy by attending meetings and engaging in conversations and communications in the continental United States and Puerto Rico to fix, stabilize and maintain rates and surcharges for Puerto Rico freight services; to allocate customers of Puerto Rico freight services between and among the conspirators; and to rig bids submitted to customers of Puerto Rico freight services.          Todays indictment charges this executive with participating in a price-fixing conspiracy that affected the cost of shipping many consumer goods to Puerto Rico, said Bill Baer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. The division will continue to vigorously pursue individuals who engage in anticompetitive behavior. None         As a result of this ongoing investigation, three companies, including Crowley, and six individuals have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Five of the individuals and the three companies have been ordered to serve sentences ranging from seven months to four years in prison and to pay more than $46 million in criminal fines. The sixth individual, Frank Peake, was convicted at trial in January 2013 and is currently scheduled to be sentenced on May 31, 2013. None
