  WASHINGTON - TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corporation, a contractor to TRICARE Management Activity, has agreed to pay $10 million to resolve civil false claims allegations, the Justice Department announced today. TRICARE is the U.S. medical benefit plan which covers uniformed personnel, retirees, their dependents and reserve components. None   Those who overbill TRICARE threaten to undermine the health care provided to our men and women in uniform, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. At a time when the federal government must tighten its belt, settlements like this one help maintain important programs that people depend on.   This office is committed to safeguarding the federal health care programs from fraud and false claims, said Melinda Haag, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. Ensuring that the programs receive the contractual savings and deductions to which they are entitled is essential to our commitment.   This settlement is part of the governments commitment to combating health care fraud. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover more than $5.9 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. The Justice Departments recoveries in false claims act cases since January 2009 are more than $7.5 billion.   The investigation and settlement of these matters were jointly handled by the Department of Justices Civil Division and the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, with assistance from the TRICARE Office of Program Integrity and the Department of Defenses Criminal Investigative Service.
