WASHINGTON  The United States has sued an Orlando, Fla., man seeking to bar him from promoting two alleged tax-fraud schemes, the Justice Department announced today.According to the government complaint in the civil injunction case in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, David Miner promotes a "decoder" scheme through a website. The government alleges that Miner falsely claims to be able to "decode" and "fix" Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records of his customers tax accounts so as to block the IRS from collecting the customers taxes. The complaint states that Miner charges each customer $1,800 for this purported service and claims to have helped more than 2,000 customers stop paying taxes.The lawsuit also alleges that Miner promotes a "pure trust" abusive tax scheme at another website. According to the complaint, Miner charges customers $2,000 to establish "pure trusts" to evade paying federal income taxes, conceal their assets, and interfere with IRS collection efforts. The government alleges that Miner falsely advises his customers that assets purportedly contributed to the trusts may not be seized by personal creditors, including the IRS.NoneNone
