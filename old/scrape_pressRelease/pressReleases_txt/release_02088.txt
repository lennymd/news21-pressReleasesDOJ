The Justice Department reached a settlement today with American Cleaning Company (ACC) resolving claims that the company discriminated against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). ACC is a maintenance and janitorial company based in Brighton, Massachusetts.The departments investigation found that from at least Jan. 15, 2009, until at least Sept. 30, 2015, ACC routinely required workers who are not U.S. citizens to produce specific documents for the Form I-9 and E-Verify processes, whereas U.S. citizens were permitted to choose whatever valid documentation they wished to prove their work authorization. Under the INA, all workers, including non-U.S. citizens, must be allowed to choose whichever valid documentation they would like to present to prove their work authorization. It is unlawful for an employer to limit employees choice of documentation because of their citizenship or immigration status.Under the terms of the settlement agreement, ACC will pay $195,000 in civil penalties, train its human resources staff on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA and review and revise its policies and procedures to conform to the requirements of the INAs anti-discrimination provision.                      Federal law prohibits discrimination against workers based on their citizenship or immigration status, including during the employment eligibility verification process, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. This Civil Rights Division will continue to protect the rights of lawful, authorized workers to do their jobs without facing discriminatory barriers.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to: different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin in hiring, firing or recruitment or referral, should contact the worker hotline above for assistance.None
