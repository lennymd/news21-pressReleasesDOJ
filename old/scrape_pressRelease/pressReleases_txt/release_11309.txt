WASHINGTON  The United States has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Jackson, Miss., to improve access to public transportation for individuals with disabilities, the Justice Department announced.The settlement, in the form of a consent decree, was approved by the city last night and is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court in Jackson. Under the terms of the decree, the city will maintain the wheelchair lifts of Jackson Public Transportation System (JATRAN), Jackson's fixed route bus system; adequately train personnel to properly assist passengers with disabilities; and meet its required level of service to passengers of Handilift, the ADA complementary paratransit service. The decree will be in effect for five years."Equal access to public transportation is a critical right that is guaranteed for people with disabilities, ensuring their ability to live independently in the community," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. "The department appreciates the city of Jackson's cooperation in resolving this matter and their commitment to moving forward with full accessibility of it transportation system."In July 2009, the department intervened in an ongoing class action filed in September 2008, by 11 Jackson residents and two non-profit organizations on behalf of individuals with disabilities against the city and JATRAN. The department's complaint alleged that the city had violated Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and their implementing regulations by failing to provide a level of public transportation services to users with disabilities that is comparable to those provided to individuals without disabilities.The agreement requires that the city:The ADA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and their implementing regulations detail the requirements with which fixed route and complementary paratransit public transportation systems must comply."The department's intervention in this lawsuit will help to insure that Jackson residents with disabilities have greater access to employment, shopping, medical care, and other services which is possible only when public transportation is made more accessible," said Don Burkhalter, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.None
