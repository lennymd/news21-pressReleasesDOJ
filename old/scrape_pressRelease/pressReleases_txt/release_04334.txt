The United States filed a civil injunction suit seeking to bar a Tampa, Florida, man from owning, operating or franchising a tax return preparation business and from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The complaint also requests that the court order the defendant to disgorge the fees that he obtained through alleged fraudulent tax return preparation.NoneThe suit alleges that Odne targets primarily low-income customers with deceptive and misleading advertisements, prepares and files fraudulent tax returns to fraudulently increase his customers refunds, and profits through unconscionable and exorbitant fees  all at the expense of his customers and the U.S. Treasury.According to the suit, there is a culture of greed at Odnes tax return preparation stores that expressly promotes and encourages the preparation of false and fraudulent federal tax returns in order to maximize corporate and individual profits. The complaint alleges that Odnes stores engage in fraudulent activity, including:  Falsely claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit;  Claiming improper filing status (i.e., head of household);  Fabricating businesses and related business income and expenses;  Fabricating itemized deductions on a Schedule A, including for unreimbursed employee business expenses, automobile expenses and charitable contributions;  Falsely claiming education credits to which customers are not entitled;  Improperly preparing returns based on paystubs rather than Forms W-2; and  Failing to provide customers with a copy of a competed tax return, as required.According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that the tax loss resulting from these activities for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years could be up to $35.5 million or more.NoneNone
