Marcus D. Washington of Knoxville, Tennessee, pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a Schedule II controlled substance; and possession with intent to distribute a Schedule II controlled substance. According to documents submitted in connection with the plea, on Sept. 25, 2013, Washington arranged for a woman identified as K.C. to meet with a client at a hotel to perform commercial sex acts. Washington did not know that this client was actually an undercover law enforcement officer. Shortly thereafter, Washington was arrested outside of the hotel and found to be in possession of Oxycodone. A subsequent investigation revealed that Washington and another person had recruited K.C. to engage in prostitution. Washington knew that K.C. was addicted to Oxycodone and that she feared withdrawal sickness. He withheld Oxycodone from K.C. until she engaged in commercial sex acts, and when K.C. objected to continuing to perform acts of prostitution, Washington used physical force and threats to compel her to continue. NoneThis case was investigated by the FBI, and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys William Nolan, Rose E. Gibson and Nicholas Durham of the Civil Rights Divisions Criminal Section, with the assistance and support of the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of Tennessee.None
