Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates released the following statement following President Obamas clemency announcement today:Todays announcement by the President to commute the prison sentences of another 61 individuals demonstrates his commitment to ensuring a fair and just criminal justice system. The clemency initiative that the President announced in 2014 is an important part of the Departments overall criminal justice reform efforts. Through cooperative bipartisan efforts with Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission and reform advocacy groups, we hope to soon realize systemic change in the length of prison sentences for these low-level drug offenders and to provide better tools for a safe and successful reentry into the community. The Department fervently shares the Presidents commitment to equal and fair justice under law and we will continue to work tirelessly to achieve this goal.
