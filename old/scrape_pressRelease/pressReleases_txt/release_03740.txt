NoneFor too many public defenders, crushing caseloads and scarce resources make it impossible to adequately represent clients who need and deserve assistance in legal matters, said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. The Constitution of the United States guarantees adequate counsel for indigent defendants, and the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that right is met.This brief recognizes the importance of the right to counsel as fundamental to a fair criminal justice process, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division will continue to ensure that this essential right is protected.Public defenders around the country are being asked to do essential, even heroic work, with a fraction of the resources they need, said Director Lisa Foster of the Office for Access to Justice. When defenders are unable to do their jobs, their clients are stripped of a critical constitutional right, and our justice system is diminished.NoneIn its amicus brief, the department asserts that, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel requires more than the mere appointment of a member of the bar. Additionally, the amicus brief goes on to explain that the right of indigent criminal defendants to an attorney may be violated by the governments actual denial of counsel or by a constructive denial of counsel. A civil action to remedy such violations is viable when traditional markers of representation such as timely and confidential consultation with clients, appropriate investigation, and meaningful adversarial testing of the prosecutions case are systemically absent or compromised and when substantial structural limitations such as a severe lack of resources, unreasonably high workloads, or critical understaffing of public defender offices result in such absence or limited representation.Both the trial court and the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that the plaintiffs could not bring a civil claim for constructive denial of counsel. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will now consider whether the plaintiffs claim can proceed.
