A Brentwood, Tennessee doctor and his wife pleaded guilty today to conspiring to defraud the United States, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and U.S. Attorney David Rivera for the Middle District of Tennessee. According to the indictment, Jeffrey Cephus McCoy Jr., 70, and Andra McCoy, 68, filed 2003 to 2007 income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that underreported their income and claimed fake income tax withholding amounts. The indictment further alleges that the McCoys submitted false documents to the IRS and placed their assets in the names of nominees and in nominee bank accounts. At the plea hearing, the McCoys admitted that from July 2002 through August 2014, they conspired to defraud the United States by impeding the IRSs collection of their income taxes. The McCoys further admitted that they filed a 2003 tax return, which falsely reported income tax withholdings of $439,850. Sentencing dates have not been set. The McCoys face a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison, a period of supervised release and monetary penalties. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and U.S. Attorney Rivera thanked special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Jaworski and Trial Attorney Alexander R. Effendi of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case. None
