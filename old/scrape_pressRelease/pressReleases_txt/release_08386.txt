NoneNone      The team of experienced prosecutors examined the shooting as a possible violation of U.S. criminal civil rights laws and as a possible violation of federal homicide statutes. With regard to the federal homicide statutes, the team of prosecutors and agents concluded that there is insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution of the CBPagent for a federal homicide offense. This review took into account evidence indicating that the agents actions constituted a reasonable use of force or would constitute an act of self defense in response to the threat created by a group of smugglers hurling rocks at the agent and his detainee.The investigation also revealed that, on these particular facts, the agent did not act inconsistently with CBP policy or training regarding use of force. Based on a careful review and analysis of all the evidence, the team concluded that evidence would not be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the CBP agent violated the federal homicide laws in the shooting of Hernandez-Guereca.NoneNoneNoneNone
