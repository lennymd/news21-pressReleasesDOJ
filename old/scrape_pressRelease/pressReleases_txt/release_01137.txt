Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein today issued the following statement:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous officials, particularly when they do not identify the country  let alone the branch or agency of government  with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long-established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.
