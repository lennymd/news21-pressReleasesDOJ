The formerCEOofTierOneBank, a $3 billion publicly traded commercial bank formerly headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, wasconvicted by a federal jurytoday for orchestrating a scheme to defraudTierOnesshareholders and to mislead regulators by concealing more than $100 million in losses on loans and declining real estate.Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Thomas R. Metz of the FBIs Omaha, Nebraska, Division and Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) Christy Goldsmith Romero made the announcement. After a two-week trial, a jury in the District of Nebraska found the former CEO, Gilbert G.Lundstrom, 74, of Lincoln, guilty on 12 of 13 counts, including charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, conspiracy to falsify bank entries, wire fraud, securities fraud and falsifying bank entries. In 2014, co-conspirators James Laphen, TierOnes former president and chief operating officer, and Don Langford, TierOnes former chief credit officer, pleaded guilty to multiple felonies in connection with their participation in the scheme.Evidence at trial showed that Lundstrom was the architect of an aggressive strategy to expand the banks portfolio beyond traditional lending in Nebraska to riskier areas like commercial real estate in Las Vegas. Once the financial crisis hit, Lundstroms bet on real estate in riskier areas decimated the bank. Lundstrom and his co-conspirators then intentionally concealed massive losses  more than $100 million  in TierOnesloan and real estate portfolio from investors and regulators and provided inflated figures in its required reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). In April 2009, Lundstrom and his co-conspirators learned that TierOne needed to increase its reserves and Loan Loss Allowance by between $34 million and $114 million, but concealed this information from shareholders and regulators in TierOnes financial statements. In addition, during TierOnes annual shareholder meeting held on May 21, 2009, the evidence showed that Lundstrom misrepresented the state of TierOnes capital ratios and reserves and whether TierOne had applied for TARP funding.In June 2010, following TierOnes ultimate disclosure of $120 million in loan losses and its subsequent delisting from the NASDAQ exchange, TierOne was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At the time of the closure, TierOne had more than 750 employees working at TierOnes headquarters in Lincoln and at its 69 branch offices located in Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas.The case was investigated by the FBIs Omaha Division and SIGTARP. The SEC also provided substantial assistance in the investigation. The casewasprosecuted by Trial Attorneys Henry P. VanDyck and L. Rush Atkinson and Senior Deputy Chief Sandra Moser of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.
