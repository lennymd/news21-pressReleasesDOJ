The Justice Departments Antitrust Division, at the request of the Federal Trade Commission, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., against Len Blavatnik for violating the premerger notification and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976 when he acquired voting securities of TangoMe Inc. in August 2014. At the same time, the department filed a proposed settlement, subject to approval by the court, under which Blavatnik has agreed to pay a $656,000 civil penalty to resolve the lawsuit.The HSR Act of 1976, an amendment to the Clayton Act, imposes notification and waiting period requirements for transactions meeting certain size thresholds so that they can undergo premerger antitrust review. Federal courts can assess civil penalties for premerger notification violations under the HSR Act in lawsuits brought by the Department of Justice. For a party in violation of the HSR Act, the maximum civil penalty is $16,000 per day.None
