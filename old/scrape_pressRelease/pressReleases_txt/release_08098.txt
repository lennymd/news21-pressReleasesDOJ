Obdulio Edu Burgos-Dominguez, 35, a Guatemalan national formerly of Seymour, Ind., pleaded guilty today in the District of Puerto Rico to one count of conspiracy to commit identification fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for profit.  Jose Sergio Garcia-Ramirez, 37, a Mexican national formerly of Rockford, Ill., pleaded guilty in the District of Puerto Rico on July 17, 2012, to one count of conspiracy to commit identification fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.  Both pleas took place before U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce J. McGiverin.       Burgos-Dominguez and Garcia-Ramirez were originally charged in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico on Mar. 22, 2012.  To date, a total of 53 individuals have been charged for their roles in the identify trafficking scheme.         Court documents allege that individuals located in the Savarona area of Caguas, Puerto Rico (Savarona suppliers) obtained Puerto Rican identities and corresponding identity documents.  Other conspirators located in various cities throughout the United States (identity brokers) allegedly solicited customers and sold Social Security cards and corresponding Puerto Rico birth certificates for prices ranging from $700 to $2,500 per set.  The superseding indictment alleges that identity brokers ordered the identity documents from Savarona suppliers, on behalf of the customers, by making coded telephone calls.   The conspirators used text mail, money transfer services and express, priority or regular U.S. mail to complete their illicit transactions.       Court documents allege that some identity brokers assumed a Puerto Rican identity themselves and used that identity in connection with the trafficking operation.   Their customers generally obtained the identity documents to assume the identity of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens and to obtain additional identification documents, such as legitimate state drivers licenses.  Some customers allegedly obtained the documents to commit financial fraud and attempted to obtain a U.S. passport.       Burgos-Dominguez admitted that he operated as an identity broker in Seymour, Ind.  Garcia-Ramirez admitted that he operated as an identity broker in Rockford, Ill.        According to court documents, various identity brokers were operating in Rockford; Seymour; Indianapolis; DeKalb, Ill.; Columbus, Ind.; Aurora, Ill.; Hartford, Conn.; Clewiston, Fla.; Lilburn and Norcross, Ga.; Salisbury, Md.; Columbus, Ohio; Fairfield, Ohio; Dorchester, Mass.; Lawrence, Mass.; Salem, Mass.; Worcester, Mass.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Nebraska City, Neb.; Elizabeth, N.J.; Burlington, N.C.; Hickory, N.C.; Hazelton, Pa.; Philadelphia; Houston; Abingdon, Va.; Albertville, Ala.; and Providence, R.I.       Garcia-Ramirez and Burgos-Dominguez are the seventh and eighth defendants to plead guilty in this case.        At sentencing, scheduled for Nov. 30, 2012, Garcia-Ramirez faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for conspiracy to commit identification fraud and a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft.  At sentencing, scheduled for Nov. 13, 2012, Burgos-Dominguez faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for conspiracy to commit identification fraud and 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for profit.
