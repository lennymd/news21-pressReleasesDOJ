  WASHINGTON    Leonard Fox a/k/a Anton a/k/a "Daddy" pleaded guilty today to a federal civil rights charge for sex trafficking of minors, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King of the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Lawrence J. Laurenzi for the Western District of Tennessee.  In U.S. District Court in Memphis, Fox admitted to recruiting and obtaining underage girls and arranging for those girls to engage in commercial sex acts for his financial benefit.  "The defendant forced children into the brutal and demeaning world of human trafficking," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King. "To sexually prey upon young girls in this manner for financial gain is particularly damaging to the victims and an affront to the society in which we live."  "Fox faces up to life in prison after his plea today where he admitted to preying upon the innocence of young girls so that he could profit at their expense," said U. S. Attorney Laurenzi. "The United States Attorneys Office takes seriously the victimization of our communitys children and will continue to investigate and prosecute these cases."  Fox faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison as well as a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is schedule for May 28, 2009.  Human trafficking prosecutions are a top priority of the Justice Department. In Fiscal Year 2008, the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorneys Offices filed a record number of criminal civil rights cases, including record numbers of both sex trafficking and labor trafficking cases.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Parker and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Jim Felte. The case was investigated by the FBI, the Memphis Police Department and the Fayette County Sheriffs Department.
