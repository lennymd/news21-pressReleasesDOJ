With the annual tax return filing deadline almost upon us, the vast majority of taxpayers are complying with their legal obligation to file accurate returns and pay the taxes that they owe. However, there are taxpayers who attempt to evade paying their fair share of taxes, file false returns, fail to file returns or seek to obstruct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)s efforts to assess or collect monies that are due. The Justice Departments Tax Division warns taxpayers who attempt to violate the federal tax laws that they face prosecution, jail, restitution and significant monetary penalties. Most Americans follow the tax law and rightfully expect that each of their fellow citizens will do the same, said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division. Yet every year some taxpayers try to take a different path  they hide money offshore, declare only a small portion of their income, make up bogus deductions and lie to the IRS if they are caught. With this years filing deadline approaching, these taxpayers should stop, reverse course and simply pay what they owe. As the Justice Departments recent criminal prosecutions make clear, the consequences for willful violations are severe: jail time and substantial monetary penalties. The majority of Americans file their taxes without issue and they would tell you that they want strong enforcement of the tax laws to ensure that we are all paying our fair share, said Chief Richard Weber of IRS Criminal Investigation. For those thinking about intentionally evading the tax laws  IRS-CI has the finest financial investigators and are trained to follow the money trail wherever it may lead.
