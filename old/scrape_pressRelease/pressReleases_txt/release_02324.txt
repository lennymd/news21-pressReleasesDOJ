Court Orders Return Preparer to Return to Her Customers the Portion of Their Refunds Diverted to Her Own Account A federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, held Barbara Lynn McCarthy in contempt for preparing federal income tax returns in violation of a prior order that prohibited her from acting as a return preparer. In 2014, the District Court enjoined McCarthy, who formerly operated as Barbaras Tax Service, from preparing tax returns. After entry of injunction, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) discovered that McCarthy continued preparing tax returns despite the courts order banning her from doing so. The court held a hearing on Aug. 11, to determine whether McCarthy had prepared returns in violation of the courts injunction. At the hearing the government established that McCarthy violated the courts order and the court has now ordered McCarthy to return to her customers the portions of their tax refunds McCarthy diverted to herself. The court also ordered McCarthy to pay the United States $2,500 for her actions after the injunction. Finally, the court ordered McCarthy to provide the government with a list of all tax returns she prepared since the injunction was put in place.  None
