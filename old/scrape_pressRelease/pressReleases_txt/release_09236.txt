None     In February 2010, an applicant for employment, who is authorized to work legally in the United States, applied to work for Generations Healthcare at its St. Francis Pavilion facility in Daly City, Calif.  According to the departments investigation, the company demanded that the applicant produce a permanent resident card, also known as a green card.  The applicant did not have a green card and instead presented an employment authorization document, which was legal documentation of her authority to work in the United States.   The company rejected her valid documentation because it had a future expiration date and told her that it could not hire her unless she presented a green card.   As a result, the applicant was unable to obtain employment with the company.       The departments investigation revealed that Generations Healthcare required all newly hired non-U.S. citizens and naturalized U.S. citizens at its St. Francis Pavilion facility to present specific and extra work authorization documents beyond those required by federal law to prove their status  a burden that was not placed on native-born U.S. citizens.   NoneNone     The lawsuit charging Generations Healthcare with discriminatory practices, filed before the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer within the Executive Office for Immigration Review, is being prosecuted by Phil Telfeyan and A. Baltazar Baca, OSC Trial Attorneys.
