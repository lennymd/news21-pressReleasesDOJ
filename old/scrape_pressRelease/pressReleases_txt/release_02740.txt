CPD, under the leadership of Chief W.H. Skip Holbrook, serves the largest city in the state of South Carolina with more than 133,000 residents. After the department completed an investigation that found that CPD was not providing the required services to allow for effective communication with persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, CPD worked cooperatively to reach an agreement to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. Under the settlement agreement, CPD will:Our first responders play a critical role in protecting the safety of our communities, and we must ensure they can communicate effectively with all people, including those with hearing disabilities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. This settlement will ensure that the Columbia Police Department complies with federal law, protects the civil rights of all its residents and more effectively advances public safety.NoneCPD Settlement Agreement
