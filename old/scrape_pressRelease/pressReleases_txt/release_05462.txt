Operating first as Cruz and Cruz Accounting, and later as Advantage Accounting Corp., Cruz directly or indirectly prepared more than 30,000 tax returns for customers since 2009. The complaint alleges that Cruz prepares returns that unlawfully understate income tax liabilities and overstate refunds by fabricating and/or exaggerating deductions and tax credits his clients are not eligible to take. Cruzs practices include fabricating losses for nonexistent businesses on customers Schedule C  Profit or Loss From Business, and falsely claiming child care and residential energy credits for which they were not eligible and did not incur.
