  WASHINGTONAttorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Tuesday  regarding the arrest of Ahmed Abu Khatallah for his role in the attack on the  U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya:  Our nations memory is long and our reach is far. The arrest of Ahmed Abu  Khatallah represents a significant milestone in our efforts to ensure justice is  served for the heinous and cowardly attack on our facilities in Benghazi.  Since  that attack  which caused the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean  Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty  we have conducted a thorough,  unrelenting investigation, across continents, to find the perpetrators.  The  arrest of Khatallah proves that the U.S. government will expend any effort  necessary to pursue terrorists who harm our citizens.  Khatallah currently faces  criminal charges on three counts, and we retain the option of adding additional  charges in the coming days.  Even as we begin the process of putting Khatallah  on trial and seeking his conviction before a jury, our investigation will remain  ongoing as we work to identify and arrest any co-conspirators. This is our  pledge; we owe the victims of the Benghazi attack and their loved ones nothing  less.
