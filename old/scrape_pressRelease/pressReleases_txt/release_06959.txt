The United States yesterday filed a complaint asking a federal court in Atlanta, Ga., to stop Matthew Adegbite and his companies MAS & Associates CPA, LLC and Mathew A. Adegbite CPA, PC, from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The complaint alleges that since at least 2008, Adegbite, who operates out of Tucker, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, has prepared more than 1,000 returns. The complaint alleges that Adebgite unlawfully understated income tax liabilities and overstated refunds by fabricating and/or exaggerating deductions and tax credits his clients are not eligible to take. Adegbites practices include fabricating Schedule C losses for non-existent businesses, and falsely claiming the First Time Home Buyer Credit for taxpayers who did not actually purchase a home. Altogether, the government complaint alleges that the loss to the U.S. Treasury from Adegbites activities may be in the millions of dollars.Over the past decade, the Justice Departments Tax Division has obtained hundreds of injunctions to stop tax fraud promoters and dishonest tax return preparers. Information about these cases is available on the Justice Departments website.Related Materials:None
