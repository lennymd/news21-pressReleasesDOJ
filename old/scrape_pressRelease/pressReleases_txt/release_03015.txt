NoneLast year was a turning point in the global effort to counter wildlife trafficking. Task Force agencies vigorously carried out the three main objectives of the National Strategy: strengthening enforcement, reducing demand and expanding international cooperation. One multi-year initiative known as Operation Crash has led to prosecutions against more than 30 individuals and businesses in U.S. courts, leading to prison terms as long as 70 months and forfeitures as high as $4.5 million.The Department of Justice is firmly committed to vigorously prosecuting illegal wildlife trafficking, one of my personal goals, said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden of the Department of Justices Environment and Natural Resources Division. Each illegally-traded horn or tusk represents not simply an object but a dead animal. We must take the profit out of wildlife trafficking to stop the criminals who are robbing from our children and grandchildren the great diversity of life on our planet.Task Force agencies last year trained more than 2,000 enforcement officials around the globe. In countering demand, Task Force campaigns in 2015 reached tens of millions of people in the United States and major markets throughout Asia to dissuade consumers from buying illegal wildlife or wildlife products. A major accomplishment in international cooperation was the September commitment by President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping to take timely and significant steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory.NoneNone
