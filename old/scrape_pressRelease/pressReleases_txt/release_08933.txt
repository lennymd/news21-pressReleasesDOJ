Pharr pleaded guilty on Aug. 18, 2011, to one count of conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise.      Dominique Steele, 21, aka C-Flack, was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison by Judge Diamond.  Steele pleaded guilty on Aug. 25, 2011, to one count of conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise and one count of discharging a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.     Nicky Evans, 31, aka Yamma, was sentenced yesterday to 88 months in prison.  Evans pleaded guilty on Aug. 23, 2011, to one count of conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise.     According to the guilty pleas, Steele, Pharr, Evans and others participated in a pattern of racketeering activity that included robberies at gun point; attempted murders; distribution of cocaine, heroin and crack cocaine; and obstruction of justice and witness intimidation.     According to court documents, Pharr and Steele were members of the Northview Heights/ Fineview Crips, while Evans was a member of the Brighton Place Crips.  The Brighton Place Crips were a criminal street gang that controlled an area of Brighton Place and Morrison Street, also known as the Mad Cave, and Federal Street in the Northside area of Pittsburgh. The Brighton Place Crips were formed in the early 1990s; in 2003, it formed an alliance with the Northview Heights/ Fineview Crips. This alliance expanded the gangs drug trafficking territory, and increased the number of gang members and associates available to preserve and protect the gangs power, territory and profits through violence.      The Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips gang maintains exclusive control over drug trafficking in these neighborhoods through continuous violence and intimidation of rivals and witnesses. Members of the gang support each other through payment of attorneys fees and bonds, as well as payments to jail commissary accounts and support payments to incarcerated members families.       In addition, gang members had violent confrontations with members of the rival Manchester OGs and other street gangs operating in the Northside Section of Pittsburgh. Members and associates obtained greater authority and prestige within the enterprise based on their reputation for violence and their ability to obtain and sell a steady supply of illegal drugs. According to court documents, the Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips gang members identify themselves by wearing blue, flashing Crips gang hand signals, and using phrases such as Cuz, C-Safe, Loc and G.K.        Steele, Evans and Pharr are three of the 26 defendants charged in February 2010 with being members or associates of the Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips, a racketeering enterprise.  This prosecution resulted from a Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Force investigation that began in 2005. To date, all members or associates of the Brighton Place/ Northview Heights Crips who were charged in this indictment have pleaded guilty to racketeering charges.  None
