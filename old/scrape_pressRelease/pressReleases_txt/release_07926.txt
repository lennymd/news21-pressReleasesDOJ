The Justice Department announced today that it has sued two Dallas tax return preparers, seeking to bar them from preparing federal tax returns for others. The civil injunction suit alleges that Ricardo Solomon and Leslie Mosley, who operate a business called Trini Tax, claim false deductions and credits on customers federal tax returns.According to the government complaint, Solomon and Mosley included fabricated claims for federal fuel tax credit and for education tax credits on tax returns that they prepared. The complaint alleges that Solomon and Mosleys false claims for federal fuel tax credits have appeared on at least 187 tax returns, and claimed at least $700,000 for the year 2011 alone. The complaint alleges that Solomon prepared a 2010 tax return for one customer that claimed false fuel tax credits for purported fuel purchases that would have cost the customer far more than she reported receiving in income that year.NoneThe complaint further alleges that Solomon and Mosley repeatedly prepared tax returns that falsely claimed their customers were entitled to an education tax credit, although they did not attend an accredited post-secondary educational institution at any point during the tax year.NoneRelated Documents:United States v.
