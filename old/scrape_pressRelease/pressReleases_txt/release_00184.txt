The former employee of a New Orleans law firm pleaded guilty today to tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Interim U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans for the Eastern District of Louisiana. According to court documents, Marcia Jordan, 46, evaded paying taxes on over $490,000 in income earned from her work at the law firm. As part of her plea, Jordan admitted to failing to file timely her income tax return for 2011 and to submitting to the IRS a false application for automatic extension of time to file her return on which she falsely estimated her total tax liability to be $0 and falsely claimed that she had already made $10,000 in tax payments. As part of her plea agreement, she has agreed to pay a total of $313,899 in restitution to the IRS for her unpaid taxes for 2009 through 2014. U.S. District Court Judge Ivan Lemelle scheduled sentencing for June 6. Jordan faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison. She also faces monetary penalties, supervised release, and restitution. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and Interim U.S. Attorney Evans commended special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, special agents of the U.S. Secret Service, and the Slidell Police Department, who investigated the case, and Trial Attorney Grace Albinson of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Maestri, who prosecuted the case.
