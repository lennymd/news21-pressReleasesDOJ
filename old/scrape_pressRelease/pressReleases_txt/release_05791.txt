    The United States filed a complaint today to bar Laquanda O. Gilmore (aka Laquanda Garrott) and her company, L&g Associates LLC, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced. The complaint alleges that Gilmore has   prepared returns that falsely claim fuel-tax and earned income tax credits.      According to the complaint, Gilmore has repeatedly and intentionally claimed bogus fuel-tax credits for her customers. The fuel-tax credit is available only to taxpayers   who   operate farm equipment or off-highway business vehicles. It is not available for vehicles driven on   highways  , nor is it available for fuel used for commuting to and from work. The complaint alleges that Gilmore prepared returns that claimed absurdly large fuel-tax credits for taxpayers who worked at national retail businesses.      The complaint also alleges that Gilmore repeatedly prepared tax returns that improperly claimed the earned income tax credit (EITC). To claim the EITC, a taxpayer must have earned income. According to the complaint, Gilmore repeatedly claimed that her customers earned income from wages or salaries, even though Gilmore did not attach any Forms W-2, which provide information about an employees income and tax withholdings, to those customers returns. According to the complaint, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records indicate that no Forms W-2 were issued to those customers in the years at issue.  None
