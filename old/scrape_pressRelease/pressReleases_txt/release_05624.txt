  RE/MAX Allegiance Relocation  Services, a Virginia-based move management company, has agreed to pay the  government $509,807 to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act  by overbilling for transportation services, the Department of Justice announced  today.   Todays settlement demonstrates our  continuing vigilance to ensure that those doing business with the government do  so legally and honestly and that taxpayer funds are not misused, said Assistant  Attorney General for the Civil Division Stuart F. Delery.  Government  contractors who seek to profit at the expense of taxpayers will be held  accountable.   The settlement relates to  allegations involving contracts to transport personal property of federal  employees relocating duty stations within the United States and between the  United States and Canada.  The government alleged that the defendant charged for  move management services that were not provided and overbilled agencies on other  moves by charging inapplicable tariff rates.   We encourage whistleblowers to  provide us with useful information to help us combat all manners of fraud on the  U.S. Government, said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Dana  J. Boente.   We will continue to investigate  allegations of federal contractors fraudulently maximizing their profits at the  expense of American taxpayers, said U.S. General Services Administration Acting  Inspector General Robert C. Erickson.
