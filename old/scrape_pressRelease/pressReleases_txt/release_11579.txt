  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice today announced a settlement agreement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) with Intellitec Colleges in Colorado Springs, Grand Junction, and Pueblo, Colo., to ensure access to its technical colleges for individuals with disabilities.  Intellitec offers career training programs for automotive technicians, drafting, medical and dental assistants, administrative professionals and more at its three campuses. The agreement requires, among other things, that Intellitec remove barriers to access at its existing facilities, ensure that future construction complies with the ADA, and ensure that any future alterations to existing facilities are, to the maximum extent feasible, readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agreement with Intellitec is the result of a compliance review conducted by the department.  "This agreement with a long-standing technical school will help ensure that job skills training is available to everyone, including individuals with disabilities," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "It is a top priority of the Justice Department to enforce the laws that guarantee that persons with disabilities have equal access to educational opportunities and the doors those opportunities open."None
