  The Attorney General made the following statement today on the Senates approval of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA):   No one should suffer from domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence or stalking, which is why I applaud the passage of the bill to reauthorize the critical Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) through the Senate. This legislation originally transformed our nations response to crimes against women, and today it helps us bring justice to victims and hold offenders accountable. The Department of Justice is committed to ending violence against women and vigorously enforcing the provisions of VAWA. None None None
