    WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today held the fourth of five joint public workshops to explore the appropriate role for antitrust and regulatory enforcement in American agriculture. The workshop, led by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, examined competition in the livestock industry and featured panel discussions on trends in the livestock industry, market consolidation and market transparency. The workshop also included opportunities for public comments. None     Ultimately, todays conversation is about much more than simply last years trends or this years challenges.  Its about livelihoods, families, this regions economy and our centuries-old American way of life, said Attorney General Holder.  Weve made these workshops a cabinet-level priority so that we can most effectively and efficiently determine how to ensure a fairer, more competitive marketplace for producers and consumers alike.    Given the consolidation that has taken place in the livestock industry over the past decades, it is critical to ensure a fair market still exists to give all players an honest chance at success, said Secretary Vilsack. A fair and competitive marketplace is important not only for producers, but also for consumers, and todays open and transparent dialogue with ranchers, farmers, academics and other industry stakeholders will provide us with a understanding of the complex issues in this important industry.
