Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates released the following statement following President Obamas commutation of 214 sentences today:"Today's historic announcement is yet another step in the administration's efforts to restore proportionality to unnecessarily long drug sentences. In just the first eight months of 2016, the President has more than doubled the number of commutations granted in all of 2015. But we are not done yet, and we expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the Clemency Initiative."
