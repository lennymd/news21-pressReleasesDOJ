      WASHINGTON  Three Pakistani citizens pleaded guilty today in the District of Columbia to conspiracy to provide material support to the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, a designated foreign terrorist organization.       The guilty pleas were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa Monaco; Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. for the District for District of Columbia; John Morton, Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and John V. Gillies, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Miami Division.       At a hearing today before U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington, D.C., Irfan Ul Haq, 37; Qasim Ali, 32; and Zahid Yousaf, 43, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.   At sentencing, which is scheduled for Dec. 9, 2011, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.   As part of their plea agreements, the defendants have agreed to a stipulated order of removal to Pakistan upon the completion of their criminal sentences.       Todays case underscores the threat posed by human smuggling networks that facilitate terrorist travel, said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.  I thank the many agents, analysts and prosecutors who were responsible for this successful investigation.        These defendants sought to smuggle someone they believed to be a member of a terrorist organization from halfway around the world into the United States, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  For financial profit, they were willing to jeopardize the safety and security of the American people.  Human smuggling operations pose a serious risk to our national security, and we will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners at home and abroad to combat this dangerous threat.        These criminals were willing to use their human smuggling network to help a terrorist slip across our border without any regard for the consequences, said U.S Attorney Machen.  Ten years after 9/11, this case reminds us that we must remain aggressive to stop terrorists from infiltrating our homeland and harming our nation.       ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents will continue to use every available resource to protect the American public from terrorist organizations and individuals who support them, said ICE Director Morton.   Todays announcement demonstrates our international resolve to ensuring that our nation is safer and more secure.  I applaud the outstanding work conducted by our HSI attach office in Ecuador who led this extensive investigation.  I would also like to commend our HSI office in Atlanta, along with our law enforcement partners in the United States and Ecuador, who assisted us in this case.       These criminals said they didnt care if the men they smuggled swept floors or blow up something. As long as they got paid, they did not care if innocent people would be killed in a potential terrorist attack, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gillies. The FBIs number one priority is counterterrorism and we will continue to work with our partners to protect the U.S. and its people from harm.       Ul Haq, Ali and Yousaf were arrested in Miami on March 13, 2011, on an indictment filed in the District of Columbia charging them with one count of conspiracy to commit alien smuggling.  Based on the defendants guilty pleas to terrorism conspiracy charges, the government will dismiss at the sentencing hearing the charges of conspiracy to commit alien smuggling against the defendants.
