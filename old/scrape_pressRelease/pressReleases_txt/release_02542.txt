The Justice Department reached an agreement today with Macys over allegations that the large national retailer violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by discriminating against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens at its Glendale, California, location.The departments investigation was based on a charge filed by a lawful permanent resident whose hiring was delayed in October 2015. The charging party alleged, and the investigation found, that she was not able to begin working at Macys even though she showed sufficient proof of her work authorization because a Macys hiring official incorrectly believed that lawful permanent residents were required to produce unexpired permanent resident cards. The investigation also found that other human resource employees in Macys Glendale location were imposing the same unnecessary requirement on four other lawful permanent residents. In contrast, U.S. citizens were permitted to choose whichever valid documents they wanted to present to prove their work authorization. Under the INA, lawful permanent residents do not have to show their permanent resident cards when they start working. Instead, like all workers, they can choose whichever documentation the would like to present, such as a drivers license and unrestricted social security card, from the lists of acceptable documents.Under the settlement agreement, Macys will, among other things, provide additional training to its employees and assess its employees understanding of applicable rules. Macys will also pay an $8,700 civil penalty and periodically produce Form I-9 information to the department for review.Macys did the right thing by immediately resolving the charging partys delayed hiring and by giving her full back pay, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. All employers should take care not to impose unlawful burdens on employees because of their citizenship or immigration status and address issues promptly when they make mistakes.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they have been subjected to: different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin in hiring, firing or recruitment or referral, should contact OSCs worker hotline for assistance.None
