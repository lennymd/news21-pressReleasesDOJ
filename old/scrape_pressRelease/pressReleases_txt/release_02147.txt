During National Community Policing Week, we will be hosting hundreds of events around the country designed to foster dialogue, promote cooperation, and help citizens and law enforcement officers get to know one another as partners in our shared efforts to build stronger, safer, and more just communities for every American.Community policing is a public safety philosophy based on partnership and cooperation between law enforcement and the communities that they are sworn to protect and serve. At the center of community policing is the idea that all members of the community, both officer and civilian, have a stake in the safety of their neighborhoods where they live and work.NoneWhile in Dallas, the Attorney General will announce $119 million in grant funding through the Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) COPS Hiring Program (CHP). These grants will provide matching funding awards to 184 law enforcement agencies across the nation, aimed at creating, or in some cases protecting, more than 900 law enforcement positions. CHP provides funding directly to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies for the hiring and rehiring of entry-level career law enforcement officers in an effort to create and preserve jobs and increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts.NoneAlso while in Dallas, the Attorney General will attend several meetings with rank-and-file officers, hold a roundtable discussion with local police chiefs, and pay respects to the families of those officers who tragically lost their lives in the line of duty this past July.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneU.S. Attorney John R.
