Settlement Provides Compensation to Victims Identified by the Department of Justice and Establishes Fair Procedures for Treating Borrowers Who Receive Disability IncomeThe Justice Department announced today that Evolve Bank & Trust has agreed to maintain revised policies, conduct employee training and compensate victims to resolve allegations that it engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of disability and receipt of public assistance in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). The FHA prohibits lenders from discriminating on the basis of disability, and the ECOA prohibits lenders from discriminating on the basis of receipt of public assistance.The settlement, which is subject to court approval, was filed today in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, where Evolve is headquartered.

This settlement will provide relief to victims of a discriminatory practice that illegally and unnecessarily burdens individuals with disabilities in violation the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.The lawsuit originated with a referral from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to the Civil Rights Division. Evolve is a member of the Federal Reserve System.Illegal discrimination on the basis of disability is unacceptable, said Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. This settlement not only provides restitution for mortgage applicants that were harmed by the banks discriminatory practices, but ensures that the bank institutes new, fair policies and trains its staff to implement them.Every individual is entitled to equal and fair treatment when applying for a loan, said U.S. Attorney Edward L. Stanton III of the Western District of Tennessee.
