  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced a Clean Water Act  settlement requiring the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) and seven  East Bay communities to conduct extensive system repairs aimed at eliminating  millions of gallons of sewage discharges into San Francisco Bay.  Under todays  agreement, EBMUD and the communities will assess and upgrade their 1,500  mile-long sewer system infrastructure over a 21-year period.  The work is  expected to cost approximately $1.5 billion.  The entities will pay civil  penalties of $1.5 million for past sewage discharges that violated federal  environmental law.   Since 2009, EPA, state and local  regulators and environmental groups have worked to reduce sewage discharges from  East Bay communities.  During that period, interim actions required EBMUD and  the East Bay communities to improve their sewer maintenance practices and gather  information to identify priorities for investment.   The San Francisco Bay covers  1,600 square miles and is the largest Pacific estuary in the Americas, a host  for millions of migratory birds and a hub of commerce and recreation for more  than 7 million Bay Area residents.  Unfortunately, the bay is under threat from  many sources of pollution, including crumbling wastewater infrastructure that  allows sewage to escape from the system.  During rainstorms, in particular,  older sewer systems can be overwhelmed, releasing rivers of sewage before fully  treated.   In addition to polluting  waterways , raw and partially treated sewage can spread disease-causing  organisms, metals, and nutrients that threaten public health. Sewage can also  deplete oxygen in the bay, threatening fish, seals and other wildlife.   For many years, the health of  San Francisco Bay has been imperiled by ongoing pollution, including enormous  discharges of raw and partially treated sewage from communities in the East  Bay, said Jared Blumenfeld, EPAs Regional Administrator for the Pacific  Southwest.  Many of these discharges are the result of aging, deteriorated  sewer infrastructure that will be fixed under the EPA order.   Todays settlement is the result  of a Clean Water Act enforcement action brought by the EPA, U.S. Department of  Justice, State Water Resources Control Board, San Francisco Bay Regional Water  Board, San Francisco Baykeeper and Our Childrens Earth Foundation.   This settlement will result in  major reductions of sewage discharges into the San Francisco Bay, said W.  Benjamin Fisherow, Chief of Environmental Enforcement in the Justice  Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division.  These improvements  will help reach our goal of eliminating pollution in the neighborhoods in these  cities and in the bay so that citizens may rest assured that they reside in a  safe, clean environment.   The seven East Bay communities in  the EBMUD settlement are:   -         City of Alameda  -         City of Albany  -         City of Berkeley  -         City of Emeryville  -         City of Oakland  -         City of Piedmont  -         Stege Sanitary District (serving El Cerrito,  Kensington, and a portion of Richmond)   The public has been required to  repair their own sewer laterals for over two years now, so it is past time that  the local agencies aggressively repair their sewer systems, said Bruce Wolfe,  Executive Officer of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Board.  This  settlement spells out how the agencies will work with the public over the next  21 years to do just that and protect the bay.   Baykeeper will be watching the  progress of these repairs closely to ensure that pollution of San Francisco Bay  is reduced and eventually eliminated, and we will take action if the repairs  fall short, said Baykeeper Executive Director Deb Self.   On an annual basis, hundreds of  millions of gallons of raw and partially treated sewage are discharged directly  to San Francisco Bay.  Also, as much as 600,000 gallons of raw sewage from  community sewer systems is first discharged onto streets and other public  areasthrough outlets such as manhole coversbefore it drains to the bay.   As part of the agreement, EBMUD  and the seven communities will:   -         repair and rehabilitate old and cracked sewer  pipes;   -         regularly clean and inspect sewer pipes to prevent  overflows of raw sewage;   -         identify and eliminate illegal sewer connections;   -         continue to enforce private sewer lateral ordinances;  and   -         ensure proactive renewal of existing sanitary sewer  infrastructure.   EBMUD will also immediately begin  work to offset the environmental harm caused by the sewage discharges, which are  expected to continue until these sewer upgrades are completed, by capturing and  treating urban runoff and contaminated water that currently flows to the bay  untreated during dry weather.
