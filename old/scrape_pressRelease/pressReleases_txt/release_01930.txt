Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch today released the following statement on the recent acts of violence and ambush style shooting of law enforcement officers:Over the last several days, the nation has witnessed a disturbing spate of violence against law enforcement officer across the country. Since Friday, Nov. 18, two law enforcement officers  U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers and San Antonio Police Department Detective Benjamin Marconi  were killed, and three others were wounded. These reprehensible acts cannot be tolerated and they again remind us of the significant hazards that public safety officers confront each and every day on our behalf.Unfortunately, recent statistics suggest that 2016 has been an especially dangerous year for police officers, with a significant increase in the number of officers killed in the line of duty since Jan. 1. As Attorney General, I regard this increase with the utmost seriousness and the Department of Justice is working closely with our partners in the field to improve officer safety and resilience. In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to assist state and local law enforcement officers in any way that we can to reduce the frequency and deadliness of these tragic incidents.I ask all Americans to join me in expressing condolences to the family and loved ones of Deputy Commander Carothers and Detective Marconi and in praying for the swift recovery of the officers who were wounded. They  and all law enforcement officers  deserve our undying respect, gratitude, and support.
