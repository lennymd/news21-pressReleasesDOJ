      WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice announced today the filing of a lawsuit against the Polica de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Police Department or PRPD) alleging the PRPD retaliated against Agent Investigator Sofa Figueroa Rossy (Figueroa) for complaining about a hostile work environment based on sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.       According to the Justice Departments complaint, the PRPD retaliated against Figueroa when, after she complained of sexual harassment, the PRPD failed to keep Figueroas complaint confidential, involuntarily transferred her out of the PRPDs Sex Crimes Division, and failed or refused to take action on Figueroas appeal of the involuntary transfer.
