None       The charging party  a Colombian native  has been a U.S. citizen since she moved to Florida in 1978.  Fluent in English, she began working for Home Care Giver Services Inc. in November 2010.  According to the departments findings, the company subjected her to insults and derogatory statements about her accent and Hispanic heritage and eventually terminated her in January 2011 because of her national origin.       Discriminating against an employee based on his or her ancestry is completely contrary to the values and laws of our nation, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing the anti-discrimination provisions of the INA, including those protecting employees from discrimination based on their national origin.     The charging party filed a lawsuit with the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO) within the Executive Office for Immigration Review on Sept. 14, 2011.  Because the charging party has already filed a complaint, the Justice Department seeks to intervene in the existing lawsuit.  The Justice Departments lawsuit is being prosecuted by Phil Telfeyan and Byron Wong, trial attorneys.  None
