  WASHINGTON    A federal court in Maine permanently barred Donna L. Hamilton from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The court also ordered the Maine resident to provide her customer lists to the government and to mail copies of the court order to her customers. Hamilton consented to the civil injunction order.None  The complaint states that Hamilton prepared approximately 82 returns during the 2006 and 2007 filing seasons. The government complaint also alleges that Hamilton prepared federal tax returns during the 2005 filing season but did not sign any of the returns. The complaint further alleges that the IRS estimates a potential $123,000 loss to the U.S. Treasury.  According to the complaint, Hamilton fabricated and/or inflated deductions relating to employees business expenses, capital losses and education credits. One example in the complaint asserts that Hamilton reported a $1,000 education credit on her customers tax return even though the customers had never provided her with any information that would suggest that they were enrolled in college or had incurred any educational expenses during the tax.None
