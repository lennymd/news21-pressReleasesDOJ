None The United States allows companies to remove gas from public lands, which belong to all of us, in exchange for the full payment of royalties owed, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler of the Justice Departments Civil Division. This settlement demonstrates that the government will hold accountable those who seek to take improper advantage of the federal royalty program at the expense of American taxpayers.NoneWhen gas companies reduce the amount of money owed to the government by taking deductions they are not entitled to, American taxpayers dont get their fair share. This settlement is a message to the entire gas industry that the government is working together to hold them accountable, said Acting U.S. Attorney Bob Troyer for the District of Colorado. The obligation to properly pay federal mineral royalties is essential to the responsible development of oil and gas from public lands, and the Department of the Interior (DOI) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is committed to working with DOJ and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue on behalf of the American public to ensure that companies meet their legal responsibilities, said Ron Gonzales, Special Agent in Charge of the DOI OIG Energy Investigations Unit.
