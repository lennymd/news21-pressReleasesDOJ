  A federal court in Los Angeles has permanently barred Nyla McIntyre of Covina, Calif. and her business, Approved Financial Services, Inc., from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. U.S. District Judge George H. King found that McIntyre requested more than $23 million in fraudulent income tax refunds for customers using "a tax fraud scheme that involves filing fraudulent federal income tax returns and other documents, including Forms 1099-OID and Forms Schedule B, with the IRS...." McIntyre "advised a number of clients that they could file fraudulent IRS Forms 1099-OID in order to secure refunds that would help pay off mortgage and/or credit card debts," according to the court.  The court found that McIntyre requested at least 62 fraudulent refunds using her tax scheme, which "is based in part on McIntyres apparent belief that secret accounts exist that can be accessed to pay these bogus refund claims." For example, court papers filed in the case showed that McIntyre requested a $2.7 million dollar fraudulent refund for a married couple residing in La Quinta, California, and a $1.1 million dollar bogus refund for a couple from Pine Grove, California. The court permanently barred McIntyre from preparing returns because "her continued work as a professional tax preparer will permit her to perpetuate this fraudulent scheme and succeed with respect to a fraction of the submissions."None  John A. DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked Grayson Hoffman, the Justice Department trial attorney who handled the case, and Shauna Henline, the IRS senior technical advisor who conducted the investigation.None
