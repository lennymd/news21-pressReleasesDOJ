    WASHINGTON  The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund today released preliminary fatality statistics for 2011, which show a 13 percent increase in the number of federal, state and local officers who died in the line of duty, from 153 in 2010 to 173 in 2011.   The data shows that 68 officers lost their lives in firearms-related incidents, 64 officers were killed in traffic-related incidents and 41 deaths were attributed to other causes.       This is a devastating and unacceptable trend. Each of these deaths is a tragic reminder of the threats that law enforcement officers faceeach day  and the fact that too many guns have fallen into the hands of those who are not legally permitted to possess them, said Attorney General Eric Holder.   Departments across the country have mourned the loss of too many dedicated colleagues and friends, but my colleagues and I at the Justice Department are determined to turn back this rising tide.   I want to assure the family members and loved ones who have mourned the loss of these heroes that we are responding to this years increased violence with renewed vigilance and will do everything within our power  and use every tool at our disposal  to keep our police officers safe.
