The Justice Department filed a statement of interest today arguing that the Fair Housing Act (FHA) requires that landlords who consider criminal records in evaluating prospective tenants do not use overly broad generalizations that disproportionately disqualify people based on a legally protected characteristic, such as race or national origin.NoneIn the statement of interest, the department aims to assist the court in evaluating whether a housing providers policy that considers criminal records in an application process produces unlawful discriminatory effects in violation of the FHA. Although the FHA does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants criminal records, the department states in its filing that categorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.The brief explains that when a housing provider has a criminal record check policy with a disparate impact, the housing provider must prove with evidence  and not just by invoking generalized concerns about safety  that the ban is necessary. Even then, the policy will still violate the FHA if there is a less discriminatory alternative.This filing demonstrates the Justice Departments steadfast commitment to removing discriminatory barriers that prevent formerly incarcerated individuals from restarting their lives, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Women and men who served their time and paid their debt to society need a place to live, yet unlawful housing policies can too often prevent successful reentry to their communities. While not all criminal records policies adopted by landlords violate the Fair Housing Act, we will take action when they do."Landlords' categorical refusals to rent to individuals who have served their debts to society can illegally discriminate against those individuals based on their race or national origin, said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York. This office will continue to work to fight such discrimination.NoneNoneNone
