The Executive Office of Immigration Review today released data on orders of removal, voluntary departures, and final decisions for the first six months of the Trump Administration.  The data released for Feb. 1, 2017  July 31, 2017 is as follows:    Pursuant to President Trumps Jan. 25 Executive Order, Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, the Department of Justice mobilized over one hundred existing Immigration Judges to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detention facilities across the country. Over 90 percent of these cases have resulted in orders requiring aliens to depart or be removed from the United States. The Justice Department has also hired 54 additional Immigration Judges since President Trump took office, and continues to hire new Immigration Judges each month. In addition to carrying out the Presidents Executive Order, the Justice Department is also reviewing internal practices, procedures, and technology in order to identify ways in which it can further enhance Immigration Judges productivity without compromising due process.NoneNoneNone
