A federal court has permanently barred Robert Jensen, a certified public accountant from San Diego, from providing tax advice or preparing federal tax returns that illegally attempt to reduce customers taxable income, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order, to which Jensen agreed without admitting the governments allegations, prevents Jensen from preparing tax returns that improperly deduct the personal expenses of customers or that attempt to reduce a customers taxable income through the unlawful use of pension plans, stock ownership plans or retirement plans. The order also bars Jensen from providing tax advice to, or preparing the federal tax returns of, any individual or entity that Jensen knows is a customer of co-defendant Scott Waage. None NoneNone
