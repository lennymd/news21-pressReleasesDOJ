She is also subject to fines and mandatory restitution if convicted.     The case was investigated by Special Agents of the IRS - Criminal Investigation.   Trial Attorneys Jason H. Poole and Michael Boteler of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Morris are prosecuting the case. None
