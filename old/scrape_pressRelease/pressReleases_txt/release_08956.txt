The dedicated public servants we are recognizing today have each made significant achievements in furthering the mission of the Justice Department, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  They have worked tirelessly to help protect our communities and keep our nation safe.  We are grateful for their extraordinary contributions to the department and to the country.       Assistant Attorney General Breuer presented the Henry E. Petersen Memorial Award to former chief of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), Michael M. DuBose.  The Petersen Award is the highest award given by the Criminal Division.  It recognizes exceptional service by an individual who has made a lasting contribution to the division.  The award honors the memory of Henry Petersen  Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division during the Watergate era and a former chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section in the 1960s.         Mr. DuBose served for more than 20 years in the federal government.  He has held numerous positions throughout the Justice Department and the Criminal Division.  Most recently, he served as a deputy chief and chief of CCIPS.  His leadership in intellectual property (IP) led to an 800 percent increase in IP prosecutions over a four-year period.  Mr. DuBose oversaw numerous important prosecutions, including the prosecution of Albert Gonzalez, the leader of the largest credit card data breach in history.  Mr. DuBose improved the departments efforts on computer forensics and collection of electronic evidence, helping to develop CCIPSs Cybercrime Laboratory into an internationally respected and renowned resource for prosecutors.  Mr. DuBose retired from the Department of Justice in the fall of 2011.        Assistant Attorney General Breuer presented the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism to Paul OBrien, director of the Criminal Divisions Office of Enforcement Operations.  John C. Keeney served in the Department of Justice for nearly 60 years, under 12 U.S. presidents and 23 attorneys general, retiring in September 2010 as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division.  The John C. Keeney Award recognizes an employee who has demonstrated outstanding professionalism and integrity over a sustained period of time or an employee who has displayed extraordinary strength of character in a unique situation, as Mr. Keeney displayed during his years of service to the federal government.

He has supervised and prosecuted complex narcotics and money laundering cases, as well as fraud, corruption, child pornography, firearms, counterfeiting and immigration offenses.

Richard Memorial Award was presented to Kenneth Harris, associate director of the Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs.  The award was created in memory of Mark M. Richard, who served the Criminal Division from 1967 to 2007, and is given to a Criminal Division employee in recognition of extraordinary vision and leadership in fighting international crime.  Mr. Richard saw the crucial importance of making law enforcement a central part of our foreign policy.         Mr. Harris received this award for his work in improving international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism.  Over the last 15 years, he has played a critical role in negotiating many of the most significant law enforcement treaties and agreements to which the United States is a party.

These accomplishments are part of the Criminal Divisions efforts to increase cooperation with our Mexican partners and enhance their law enforcement capacity.
