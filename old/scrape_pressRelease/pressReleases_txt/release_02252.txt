Its a Callery pear tree that once stood on the original World Trade Center Plaza. The collapse of the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001 nearly destroyed it, but it was nursed back to health, and today it stands strong again at the Memorial, where it is often adorned with tributes from the Memorials millions of visitors. It is known around the world as the Survivor Tree.Fruit from the Survivor Tree was harvested in the fall of 2011 by Bartlett Tree Experts. In the summer of 2013, the students of John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens, New York, took custody of the seedlings and have continued to care for them. The project is a learning experience for the students, teaching about the agriculture of the trees and the history of 9/11.Each year the 9/11 Memorial donates a Survivor Tree Seedling to a community who has overcome tragedy. These communities represent the spirit of the Survivor Tree and their tree will serve as an inspirational landmark conveying resiliency and hope within the community, just as the Survivor Tree does at the 9/11 Memorial. In 2015, the 9/11 Memorial graciously donated one of these unique seedlings to DOJ, and today, it continues to flourish in the courtyard of Main Justice.
