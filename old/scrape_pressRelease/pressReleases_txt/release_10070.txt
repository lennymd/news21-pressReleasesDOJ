      WASHINGTON  A Maryland woman has been charged by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., with making false statements   and submitting false documents in multiple job applications to U.S. federal government agencies, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride of the Eastern District of Virginia; James W. McJunkin, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office; and Inspector General H. David Kotz of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC.)  None       According to the indictment,   Lancaster was employed in various positions with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)   from   1991 until March 2005, when she was notified by DoD that she was being fired due to performance failures.   In October 2006, according to the indictment, Lancaster reached a settlement with DoD in which she was allowed to resign from DoD, retroactive to March 2005. None       Specifically, according to the indictment,   Lancaster   concealed and falsified information in her application materials about her prior arrests, charges, convictions and prison terms; the unfavorable circumstances under which she had resigned from prior federal employment; the roles and responsibilities she had at previous federal jobs; and her salary history.       The maximum penalty for each count of making a false statement, submitting a false document and engaging in a concealment scheme is five years in prison. Lancaster also faces a maximum fine of $250,000 per count.       An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.       This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Ethan H. Levisohn and Peter Mason of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark D. Lytle for the Eastern District of Virginia.  The case was investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office and the SECs Office of Inspector General.
