  Mississippi-based Hancock County Land LLC (HCL) pleaded guilty today to the unpermitted filling of wetlands near Bay St. Louis, Miss., and agreed to pay a $1 million fine and take remedial measures for two felony violations of the Clean Water Act, announced Assistant Attorney General Ignacia S. Moreno of the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Gregory K. Davis. HCL admitted causing the unauthorized excavation and filling of wetlands on a 1,710 acre parcel of undeveloped property in Hancock County, west of the intersection of Route 603 and Interstate 10.  According to the charges filed in federal court in Jackson, Miss., when HCL purchased the property, it had been informed by a wetland expert that as much as 80 percent of its land was federally protected wetland connected by streams and bayous to the Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, that the property could not be developed without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Such permits typically require that developers protect and preserve other wetlands to compensate for those they are permitted to fill and destroy.NoneNone  "The defendant deliberately destroyed wetlands that are protected by the law," said Maureen O'Mara, Special Agent in Charge of EPA's criminal enforcement program in Mississippi. "This is a great example of local, state, and federal agencies working together to hold companies accountable for putting profit above the requirements of the law."None  Real estate developer and HCL minority owner, William R. Miller, was charged in November 2012 with Clean Water Act violations related to the same unauthorized excavation and filling of wetlands near Bay St. Louis. That case is expected to be scheduled for trial over the next few months.
