A Flossmoor, Illinois, man was sentenced to serve 46 months in prison and three years of supervised release by U.S. District Court Judge Michael M. Mihm in the Central District of Illinois for obstruction of justice and filing false retaliatory liens against government officials, the Justice Departments Tax Division announced today.Tyree Davis Sr. pleaded guilty on July 18, 2014, to two counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of filing false retaliatory liens. A federal grand jury in Chicago returned an eight count indictment on July 24, 2013, charging Davis with two counts of obstruction of justice and six counts of filing false retaliatory multi-billion dollar liens against government employees.According to court documents, Davis sent correspondence threatening to arrest two federal judges, including the judge who presided over the 2010 criminal tax trial of LaShawn Littrice. A jury convicted Littrice, who Davis has referred to as his wife, in June 2010, and she was sentenced to serve 42 months in prison. Court documents also establish that Davis filed false retaliatory liens, titled Notice of Claim of Maritime Lien, against the two federal judges. Davis also filed false retaliatory liens against the U.S. Attorney and Clerk of Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and the Assistant U.S. Attorney and the special agent from the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation who investigated and prosecuted Littrice. Davis filed the liens with the Cook County Recorders Office claiming that each individual owed Littrice $100 billion dollars. Davis re-recorded the liens multiple times in order to add real property descriptions, then notified others, including credit bureaus, that he had filed the multi-billion dollar liens.The case was prosecuted by the Senior Litigation Counsel Jen E. Ihlo and Trial Attorney Matthew J. Kluge of the Tax Division and was investigated by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and the FBI.
