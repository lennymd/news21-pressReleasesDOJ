Since 2009, the Department has made fighting crime in Indian Country a top priority and has pursued an aggressive strategy consisting of law enforcement action, prosecution, grant funding, training, technical support, and collaboration with tribal partners that is already showing success.   For example, the Departments renewed commitment to the vigorous prosecution of federal crimes in Indian Country has increased the number of Indian Country prosecutions by United States Attorneys Offices nationwide by more than fifty percent over the past four years.   NoneNoneNone    Since taking Office, Attorney General Holder has consistently emphasized that combatting violent crime in Indian Country and fostering safe communities is a top priority of the Department of Justice.   Attorney General Holder has stated that when it comes to this challenge, we must recommit ourselves to collaboration on an unprecedented scale.   To this end, the Department took steps in early 2010 to ensure that each United States Attorneys Office with responsibilities in Indian Country implemented a district-specific operational plan to formalize its strategy for consulting and working with tribal, state, and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and other leaders, to improve public safety in Indian Country.   For example, in North Dakota, our operational plan took the form of an Anti-Violence Strategy that combines enhanced enforcement of federal criminal laws with support for viable crime prevention programs and efforts to build a sustainable offender reentry program.   Our plan has now been in place for almost three years and has resulted in unprecedented levels of communication and collaboration between the U.S. Attorneys Office and the tribes in North Dakota as well as a large increase in the number of Indian Country cases being prosecuted by our Office.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone  This increase in prosecutions is due to many factors, but efforts by U.S. Attorneys to enhance investigative and prosecutorial coordination with tribal partners have been critical to this improvement.  A great example of how collaboration improves law enforcement can be found in Montana.   In 2010, Montana United States Attorney Mike Cotter began convening bi-monthly meetings involving the federal prosecutors assigned to each reservation, the tribal prosecutors for the reservation, and tribal and federal law enforcement officers.   During these meetings, cases arising on a particular reservation during the preceding two-week period are discussed and a decision is reached collaboratively concerning which jurisdiction  Federal or tribal or both  will prosecute a particular case.   This close communication ensures that serious Indian Country crimes are appropriately investigated and that the decision whether a matter will be charged in federal court or tribal court is an informed one.NoneNoneNoneNone  The commitment of the U.S. Attorneys Offices in Indian Country has been supported by Department components that have provided much-needed training to law enforcement and prosecutors who are working in Indian Country.   For example:None None  Finally, the Department is also working to ensure that, in our work in Indian Country, we remain focused on providing critical services to the victims of crime.   Since 2009, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), within the Office of Justice Programs, has provided over $2.6 million to the BIA to support victim assistance positions in Montana, South Dakota, Arizona, and New Mexico and has helped to build the capacity of sexual assault services in Indian Country through such innovative partnerships as the Department and the Indian Health Service working together to establish the American Indian/Alaska Native Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner-Sexual Assault Response Team (SANE-SART) Initiative, which addresses the comprehensive needs of tribal victims of sexual violence.NoneNoneNone  While the new laws tribal criminal jurisdiction provision takes effect on March 7, 2015, VAWA 2013 also authorizes a voluntary Pilot Project to allow tribes to begin exercising special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction sooner.   The Department received the first set of requests from six tribal governments to participate in the Pilot Project and last week three tribes  the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, the Umatilla Tribes of Oregon, and the Tulalip Tribes of Washington  were granted Pilot Project approval by the Department.   They will be the first tribes in the nation to exercise special criminal jurisdiction over crimes of domestic and dating violence, regardless of the defendants Indian or non-Indian status, under VAWA 2013.NoneNoneNone    The Department agrees that few issues are more critical to the long-term improvement of public safety in Indian Country than working with young people to break the cycle of violence and hopelessness we have come to see on some reservations.   Recognizing the importance of this issue, the Department is working to improve juvenile justice in Indian Country.   None NoneNone  The Task Force is made up of an Advisory Committee of tribal members and national experts  in academia, child health and trauma, and child welfare and law  and a Working Group that, along with me, includes U.S. Attorneys Amanda Marshall from Oregon, Brendan Johnson from South Dakota, and Barry Grissom from Kansas, as well as other top officials from the Departments of Justice, the Interior, and Health and Human Services.
