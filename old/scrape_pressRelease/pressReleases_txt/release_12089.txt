  WASHINGTON  Endoscopic Technologies Inc. (Estech), a medical device manufacturer, has agreed to pay the United States $1.4 million to resolve civil claims in connection with the alleged promotion of its surgical ablation devices, the Justice Department announced today. Surgical ablation devices use focused energy to create controlled lesions or scar tissue on a patients heart or other organs.  The settlement resolves allegations that the San Ramon, Calif.-based company marketed its medical devices to treat atrial fibrillation (the most common cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm), a use that is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The government also alleged that Estech promoted expensive heart surgeries using the companys devices when less invasive alternatives were appropriate, advised hospitals to up-code surgical procedures using the companys devices to inflate Medicare reimbursements, and paid kickbacks to healthcare providers to use its devices. The United States asserted that by engaging in this conduct, Estech knowingly violated the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims in violation of the False Claims Act.  "The Department of Justice is committed to protecting Medicare from the unlawful marketing practices of Estech and other medical device manufacturers," said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division. "We will continue to work with our partners at the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector Generals Office and the FDA Office of Chief Counsel to preserve the integrity of our public health programs."NoneNone  The settlement with Estech was the result of a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and the FDA Office of Chief Counsel.
