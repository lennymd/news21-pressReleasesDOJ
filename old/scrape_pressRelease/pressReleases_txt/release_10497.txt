The first workshop was held in March in Ankeny, Iowa, with a focus on row crops and hogs.  Held in Normal, Ala, in May, the second workshop addressed issues in the poultry industry.  The third workshop focused on issues in the dairy industry and was held in Madison, Wis., in June.  The fourth workshop, held in August in Fort Collins, Colo., looked at the livestock industry.
