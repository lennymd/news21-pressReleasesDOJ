A federal court in Sacramento, California, has permanently barred a former Ripon, California, man from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction order, to which Sarad Chand consented, was entered by U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. of the Eastern District of California. According to stipulation, the defendant admitted to repeatedly preparing federal tax returns that understated his customers federal tax liabilities.NoneThe suit also noted that on May 15, 2014, Chand pleaded guilty to aiding and assisting in the preparation and presentation of a false and fraudulent tax return. As part of his plea agreement, Chand agreed to the entry of a permanent civil injunction.The suit alleged that the IRS had completed examinations of 919 of the approximately 8,155 tax returns Chand prepared from 2008 to 2012, and that nearly all of the examined returns resulted in a finding of deficiency or denial of a refund claim. The 886 returns found to be inaccurate had a total tax understatement of more than $2.7 million.The injunction requires Chand to provide a list of customers for whom he has prepared federal tax returns or claims for refund since Jan. 1, 2012.None
