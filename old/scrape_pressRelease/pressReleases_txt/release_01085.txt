Today Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with families who have lost loved ones because of crimes committed by illegal aliens. In the meeting they discussed the progress being made by the Trump Administration to strengthen laws protecting Americans from crimes committed by illegal aliens and, the need to keep working to ensure that federal immigration laws are enforced.It was a great honor for me to meet with these families, and I was impacted by their stories, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The tragic burdens they carry remind us of the urgent need by the federal government to fully enforce our immigration laws and to secure the borders of this country. No Americans should experience what these families have suffered. I want to thank these strong moms, dads, siblings and widows for ensuring that their loved ones dont die in vain by using their voices to affect the real changes that we are implementing. I commit to them, and I commit to the American people that the Department of Justice will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of every American community.Attending the meeting with the Attorney General were Maureen Laquerre and Maureen Maloney of Massachusetts, Juan Pia and Sabine Durden of California, Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann Mendoza of Arizona and Laura Wilkerson of Texas.
