Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch today released the following statement on the passing of U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers:I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers -- a devoted husband, a loving father and an outstanding public servant. Deputy Commander Carothers served the American people with fidelity and courage throughout his distinguished career. He stayed true to his oath to the last, laying down his life to keep his community safe and his neighbors secure. I know that his legacy will live on in the proud annals of the U.S. Marshals Service and in the memory of his fellow law enforcement officers from coast to coast. I join all the men and women of the U.S. Department of Justice in extending my thoughts and prayers to Deputy Commander Carotherss wife, children and loved ones. We will honor his heroic sacrifice by continuing the work for which he so valiantly gave his life: the work of building a stronger, safer and more just United States.
