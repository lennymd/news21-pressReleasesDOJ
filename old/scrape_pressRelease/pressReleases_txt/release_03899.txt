Today, the Justice Department reached a settlement agreement with Robertson County (Tennessee) Schools to revise assignment plans for middle and high school students in the district to promote diversity and ensure access to high quality educational programs for all students. As a part of the student assignment plan, the agreement also requires the development of a new, innovative Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) magnet program at Springfield Middle School, which will be open to and draw students from across the district.The district, together with an expert consultant, will develop a plan to recruit and enroll a desegregated student population for the STEM magnet, which will open in the 2016-2017 school year. The STEM magnet will receive dedicated resources and provide quality course offerings and facilities such as science labs. Students will be able to progress in their STEM coursework at Springfield High School. If the district is unsuccessful in recruiting a desegregated enrollment to Springfield Middle School through the magnet program, alternative rezoning plans will go into effect.The district was required to revise its student assignment plans as a condition of the settlement agreement reached with the department on Feb. 2, 2015. That agreement, in addition to the agreement reached today, aims to resolve the departments determination that the district had yet to fulfill its desegregation obligations in the areas of student assignment and school construction.I commend the Robertson County school board for unanimously approving this agreement to advance educational opportunities for all students, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department is committed to working with Robertson County Schools to effectively implement the agreement and fulfill the districts obligations to desegregate.None
