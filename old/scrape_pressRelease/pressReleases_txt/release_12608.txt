  WASHINGTON  A federal court in Maine has permanently barred Robert A. Grover from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The court also ordered the Maine resident to provide his customer lists to the government and to mail copies of the complaint and court order to his customers. Grover consented to the civil injunction order.None  The governments complaint alleges that Grover prepared more than 2,600 federal tax returns during a four-year period. According to the complaint, Grover fabricated and/or inflated deductions and understated gross receipts on his customers Schedule C forms. In addition, the complaint alleges that Grover failed to report capital gains from the sale of assets on some of his customers Schedule D forms. Grover also allegedly fabricated and/or inflated deductions related to his customers rental properties on Schedule E forms. In the complaint, the government estimates that the U.S. Treasury has incurred from $1 million up to $29.5 million in losses from tax returns prepared by Grover.  Acting Assistant Attorney General John A. DiCicco thanked Tax Division trial attorney Lisa Bellamy for her handling of the governments case. The Justice Department has obtained injunctions against more than 365 tax return preparers and tax-fraud promoters since 2001.None
