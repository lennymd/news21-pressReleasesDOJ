WASHINGTON  Former White Mountain Apache Tribal police officer, Glenn Cromwell, 35, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Phoenix to two counts of violating civil rights while acting under color of law for detaining, transporting, and then abandoning two adult males in extreme weather conditions on different occurrences in December 2008. During the plea hearing, Cromwell admitted to violating the constitutional rights of two men by detaining and driving each, in separate incidents, to a remote location and then forcing the men out of the police vehicle and leaving them in the frigid cold. In both instances, Cromwell willfully exceeded and abused his authority under law. This police officer had no legitimate purpose for deliberately exposing persons in his custody to perilous conditions, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. His conduct undermines the dedicated work of the men and women in law enforcement who serve and protect our communities. T he Justice Department is committed to holding officers who engage in such criminal acts accountable. Sentencing for Cromwell is scheduled for Feb. 13, 2012. Cromwell faces a possible maximum sentence of one year in prison for each count. This case was investigated by the Phoenix Field Office of the FBI and was prosecuted by Trial Attorney D.W. Tunnage of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison S. Bachus for the District of Arizona.
