The Justice Department today made public its plan of action, submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to improve consultation and coordination between the Justice Department and tribal nations, as directed by President Barack Obamas Memorandum on Tribal Consultation. The Presidential Memorandum, signed on Nov. 5, 2009, at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, directed each federal agency to submit to OMB within 90 days a plan of action to implement President Clintons Executive Order 13175 on Consultation and Coordination with Tribal Governments. The Justice Departments plan was submitted to OMB on January 27, 2010.NoneThe Justice Departments plan of action was driven largely by input gathered from the departments own Tribal Nations Listening Session in late October 2009 and from the departments annual tribal consultation on violence against women, as well as from written comments submitted by tribal governments, groups and organizations to the Justice Department and tribal consultation conference calls conducted by the Office of Tribal Justice.None
