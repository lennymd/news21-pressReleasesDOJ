  The Justice Department announced today that it reached an agreement with FTD Inc., to resolve allegations that the company retaliated against a man for asserting rights under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).      The Justice Department initiated the investigation after receiving a complaint from a work-authorized immigrant that FTD rescinded the individuals conditional job offer after a background check revealed a purported error in his Social Security account number.   The man informed FTD that he was authorized to work in the United States and provided documents showing his status.   The man also expressed concern to FTD that the company may be violating the anti-discrimination provision of the INA by refusing to hire him and threatened to pursue his legal rights under the INAs anti-discrimination provision.   FTD responded by terminating all communication with the individual.        Under the terms of the agreement, FTD has agreed to pay $1,800 in back pay to the man and $3,000 in civil penalties.   FTD has also agreed to undergo Justice Department training on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA.   The case settled prior to the Justice Department filing a complaint in this matter.   People authorized to work in this country should not be afraid to dispute errors in databases relating to their employment eligibility or documents, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. It is unlawful to retaliate against an individual for asserting a right to work under the anti-discrimination provision of the INA.
