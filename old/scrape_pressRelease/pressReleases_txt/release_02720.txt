The Justice Departments Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) today released a grant solicitation launching the new Grants to Tribal Governments to Exercise Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction Program (Tribal Jurisdiction Program). This new program was authorized in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013) and received its first appropriation in fiscal year 2016.VAWA 2013 recognizes tribes inherent power to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction (SDVCJ) over certain defendants, regardless of their Indian or non-Indian status, who commit acts of domestic violence or dating violence or violate certain protection orders in Indian country.
