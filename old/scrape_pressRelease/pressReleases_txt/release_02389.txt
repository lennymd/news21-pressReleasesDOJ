Payment on All Group A Claims Has Been AuthorizedNoneThe 9/11 VCF staff learned a great deal over the past five years about which claim form questions were truly necessary and as a result, the Fund was able to reduce the number of overall questions and combine the four versions of the old claim form into one, simplified form. Additionally, VCF staff solicited input from many law firms that represent VCF claimants and incorporated their feedback into the new form and the redesigned online claims system.We appreciate the 9/11 communitys support as the Funds staff worked over the past six months to finalize the new claim form and believe claimants will agree it was worth the wait, said Special Master Bhattacharyya. There is much work yet to be done and I stand ready to help the VCF build upon its successes and move into the next phase of the program with a renewed sense of purpose and commitment to the 9/11 community to provide the deserved compensation to those who have suffered as a result of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The new form results in the need for fewer documents to be submitted in support of a claim and the multiple attestations, certifications and exhibits used with the old claim forms have been replaced with a single signature page. The online system guides claimants to answer only those questions that are applicable to their individual circumstances and also includes a new smart document checklist that identifies the documents the claimant will need to submit based on answers to specific claim form questions. Overall, the new online system and claim form are much easier to navigate and more user-friendly  two key goals the VCF set at the start of this effort.With the launch of the new claim form, the online claims system has returned to full functionality, including the ability to file online amendments to previously submitted claims.None
