On Feb. 20, a federal court permanently barred a Kahului, Hawaii, man from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii issued the injunction finding that James A. Ericson knowingly and repeatedly violated the Internal Revenue Code by preparing returns that understated his customers tax liabilities and by taking unreasonable positions in filing his customers returns. The court found that an injunction permanently barring him from preparing federal tax returns for others was necessary to prevent further recurrence of Ericsons practices. The courts order applies to Ericson and all those in active concert or participation with him.The complaint alleged that Ericson prepared roughly more than 1,000 tax returns per year. According to the complaint, Ericson improperly understated his customers federal tax liabilities by fabricating business schedules, expenses and business income for non-existent businesses; claiming false or inflated credits; and deducting personal expenses that were not legally deductible. The suit also alleged that Ericson falsely claimed to some of his customers that he was a former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee. In total, the governments complaint alleged that the loss to the U.S. Treasury from Ericsons activities may have exceeded $31 million for tax years 2007 through 2012.The courts order requires Ericson to produce to the government counsel a list of all persons for whom he has prepared federal tax returns or claims for a refund since Jan. 1, 2008, and to notify all such persons of the injunction entered against him.None
