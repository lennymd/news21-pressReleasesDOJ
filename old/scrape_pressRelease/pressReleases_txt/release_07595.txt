None         The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeks to dissolve the joint venture and impose other relief to restore competition and redress the anticompetitive effects of the parties conduct. In addition to the joint venture itself, the complaint names as defendants Coach and City Sights, and the subsidiaries through which they entered Twin America, International Bus Services Inc. and City Sights Twin LLC.         The formation of Twin America eliminated intense head-to-head competition between Coach and City Sights and gave the parties an effective monopoly that enabled them to raise prices to consumers, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata B. Hesse in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. This lawsuit seeks to restore the competition eliminated by the joint venture and to ensure that the millions of visitors to New York City who take hop-on, hop-off bus tours each year enjoy the benefits of a competitive marketplace.         This lawsuit is an important step toward restoring competition and protecting tourists in New York City, said New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. The iconic double-decker Gray Line and City Sights buses are seen all over New York City but few people know they are run as a monopoly. The formation of Twin America has meant higher prices and less competition. Tourists who come to the Big Apple deserve better.         New York City is one of the worlds premier tourist destinations, drawing approximately 50 million visitors annually. An estimated two million of these visitors spend more than $100 million each year on hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Hop-on, hop-off bus tours combine sightseeing and transportation by providing tourists with a professionally-guided tour of New York Citys leading attractions and neighborhoods, while giving them the ability to hop off the tour bus at various locations to further explore attractions of interest and later hop on another bus to continue along the tour route using the same ticket. The tours are offered on open-top double-decker buses, which enable passengers to view New York Citys attractions and neighborhoods from a heightened vantage point.
