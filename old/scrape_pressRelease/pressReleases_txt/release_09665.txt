None None       Knapps illegal conduct put at risk the health of workers who lacked basic training and protective equipment, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Department of Justice.  The Clean Air Act work practice standards are designed to protect peoples health from real dangers, and we will hold violators fully responsible for their actions.         This office will continue to pursue serious violations of the environmental laws that put the community at risk, said Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa.  Compliance with the Clean Air Act is tremendously important to ensuring good health and the quality of life that Iowans enjoy.         Ignoring the safeguards put into place to protect workers and the public from the risk of exposure to asbestos is inexcusable, said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Todays sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime and sends a strong warning to any anyone thinking of cutting corners to save money at the expense of peoples health.      None      According to testimony presented at sentencing, while Knapp was overseeing the project, asbestos-containing material was removed from the building and disposed of in an uncovered dumpster.  The testimony also showed that the demolition work was performed by workers who were not provided with personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to the asbestos.  Testimony also showed that the building workers, one of whom was disabled, and tenants, were exposed to large amounts of dust that resulted from the demolition.  A worker testified that the workers were not instructed to wet the tile containing asbestos before and during the demolition process, which increased their exposure to dust.        The Clean Air Act requires that owners of public buildings that contain asbestos follow federally established work practice standards to ensure the safe removal of the asbestos. The required standards include providing notice to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before starting asbestos removal, adequately wetting the asbestos during the removal and before disposal, and properly disposing of the asbestos at an EPA-approved disposal site.       The case was investigated by the EPAs Criminal  Investigation Division and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Iowa and the U.S. Justice Departments Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural Resources Division.
