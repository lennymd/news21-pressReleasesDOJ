Neronha of the District of Rhode Island and Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeff Ebersole of the Office of FDA Criminal Investigations New York Field Office.The misbranding of drugs is an ongoing and increasing threat to public safety in general, said U.S. Attorney Neronha. Here, the defendants criminal conduct was particularly egregious. He misbranded not just any drug, but an incredibly dangerous one, one used to victimize unsuspecting innocent people, on an enormous scale. The lengthy prison sentence he has received is well-deserved.The defendants actions exposed unsuspecting consumers to potentially serious danger, said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ebersole. This investigation demonstrates the Office of Criminal Investigations commitment to vigorously pursue criminal violations that threaten the public health. We thank our partners from the U.S. Attorneys Office in the District of Rhode Island, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service for their efforts in this case.At sentencing, U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E.
