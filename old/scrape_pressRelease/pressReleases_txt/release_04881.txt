A federal court in Columbus, Georgia, has permanently barred Natashia and Detrick Tucker and their business, T&T Express Tax, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction order, to which the defendants consented, was signed by Chief Judge Clay D. Land of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.According to the complaint, the Tuckers prepared federal income tax returns for customers that understated the taxes due or generated inappropriate tax refunds. The understatements were caused by improper earned income tax credits and education credits that the Tuckers claimed for their customers. According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examined 337 returns of the 2,239 returns prepared by the Tuckers for the tax years 2009 through 2011. Of those returns, the IRS determined that adjustments were needed on more than 87 percent of the examined returns.NoneNone
