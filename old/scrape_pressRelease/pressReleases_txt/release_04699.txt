Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement on the departure of U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson:During Brendan Johnson's tenure as United States Attorney for South Dakota, he has distinguished himself as an exemplary leader, a passionate advocate for his fellow citizens, and an extraordinarily dedicated public servant," said Attorney General Holder. "As a lawyer and as a leader, Brendan has set a standard of excellence that will not soon be surpassed. Particularly with regard to public safety challenges on tribal lands, he has served as a key advisor to senior Justice Department officials - including me. As past Chair of the Native American Issues Subcommittee, he is not only a respected champion for tribal justice in his own right, but a critical national leader - offering sound guidance, wise counsel, and candid advice on a host of pressing issues. In standing against violent crime, fraud, drug trafficking, violence against women, and countless other threats, Brendan's fierce and determined service, on behalf of the people of South Dakota, has been without equal. Although he will be greatly missed, his many contributions will endure. I thank him for his outstanding service - to South Dakota, and to our nation - and wish him all the best as he takes on new challenges and opportunities.
