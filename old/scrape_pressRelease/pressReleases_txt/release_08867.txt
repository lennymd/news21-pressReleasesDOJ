      WASHINGTON Maersk Line Limited has agreed to pay the government $31.9 million to resolve allegations that it submitted false claims to the United States in connection with contracts to transport cargo in shipping containers to support U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Justice Department announced today. The government alleges that Maersk, a wholly-owned American subsidiary of Denmark-based A.P. Moller Maersk, knowingly overcharged the Department of Defense to transport thousands of containers from ports to inland delivery destinations in Iraq and Afghanistan.       The government contends that Maersk inflated its invoices in various ways. For example, Maersk allegedly billed in excess of the contractual rate to maintain the operation of refrigerated containers holding perishable cargo at a port in Karachi, Pakistan, and at U.S. military bases in Afghanistan; allegedly billed excessive detention charges (or late fees) by failing to account for cargo transit times and a contractual grace period; allegedly billed for container delivery delays improperly attributed to the U.S. government; allegedly billed for container GPS-tracking and security services that were not provided or only partially provided; and allegedly failed to credit the government for rebates of container storage fees received by Maersks subcontractor at a Kuwaiti port.         Our men and women in uniform overseas deserve the highest level of support provided by fair and honest contractors, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. As the Justice Departments continuing efforts to fight procurement fraud demonstrate, those who put profits over the welfare of members of our military will pay a hefty price.  None      Contractors that submit false claims for monies they are not owed cost the government millions of dollars every year, said Melinda Haag, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. This settlement should send a strong signal that the government is committed to safeguarding taxpayer funds by ensuring that contractors operate ethically and responsibly.       The settlement with Maersk was the result of a coordinated effort among the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Departments Civil Division; the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Department of Defense; the Armys Criminal Investigation Command; and the Defense Contract Audit Agency of the Department of Defense.        Aggressively investigating any allegation of fraudulent practices, such as those taken by Maersk Line Limited in order to profit at the expense of the safety and welfare of Americas Warfighters  especially those serving in dangerous locations such as Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as the security of the United States, is the Department of Defense Inspector Generals and the Defense Criminal Investigative Services highest priority, said James Burch, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations, Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. The settlement with Maersk was only made possible through our partnership with the Army Criminal Investigation Command and the hard work by attorneys from the Department of Justice and auditors from the Defense Contract Audit Agency.       We are fully committed to tirelessly pursuing all those who knowingly submit false claims with respect to military contracts, particularly while our nations finest are at war, said Major General David Quantock, the Provost Marshal General of the U.S. Army and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. Our commitment is to ensure taxpayer dollars are not wasted or stolen. During the last 10 years alone, Army CID Special Agents have been instrumental in recovering and returning $2.1 billion dollars to the Treasury and the Army from fraudulent practices involving contractors.
