Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. released the following statements regarding the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:Justice Antonin Scalia was, and will always be remembered as, one of the most influential and eloquent Justices ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, said Attorney General Lynch. His indomitable conviction and his fierce intelligence left a lasting imprint  not just on the way the Supreme Court resolves cases, but on the legal landscape that he helped to transform. A lion of American law has left the stage, and it is up to all of us  every American  to keep our national constitutional dialogue as lively and as learned as he left it.I am saddened by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, said Solicitor General Verrilli. He was a great jurist and a great man who served the Court and the country with honor and distinction. We will miss him very much. On behalf of my colleagues in the Office of the Solicitor General, I extend our deepest condolences to Mrs. Scalia and to the rest of his family.
