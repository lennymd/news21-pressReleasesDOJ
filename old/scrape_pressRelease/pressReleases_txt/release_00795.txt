None The Justice Department is committed to pursuing any fraudsters seeking to capitalize on the tragedy and will devote the necessary resources to do so, said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. It is imperative that the department is able to properly track and manage its response to claims of disaster fraud and that agencies receive timely and relevant investigative leads and other relevant information. By working together, we can ensure that federal emergency relief funds are properly distributed to those who need them most and that taxpayers are not victimized by fraudsters or other criminals. The National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) has already received hundreds of complaints across the country. The NCDF has remained operational since its inception following Hurricane Katrina and is specifically designed to be ready for situations like Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria. NCDF has an excellent staff of investigators, analysts, call center operators, and managers prepared to handle the anticipated volume. None NoneNoneNone
