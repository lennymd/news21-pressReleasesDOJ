  WASHINGTON  Jack A. Taylor, 68, a resident of Rolling Springs, Ky., pleaded guilty today to producing child pornography and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division Rita M. Glavin and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana Timothy M. Morrison announced.  Taylor, appearing before U.S. District Court Judge David F. Hamilton in Indianapolis, was also ordered to serve a lifetime of supervised release following completion of his prison term, forfeit all items seized during the investigation that were used to commit his offense, and to pay $4,000 in restitution to his victim.  At the plea hearing, Taylor admitted that the statement of facts presented by the government was accurate. The statement of facts established that during the early fall of 2006 Taylor traveled from Kentucky to Lebanon, Ind., where he took sexually explicit photos of a minor, Jane Doe, who was approximately four years old at the time. The statement of facts further established that Taylor engaged in sexually abusive conduct with the four-year-old minor. Finally, the statement detailed how Taylor also transported images of child pornography on a computer CD from Kentucky to Indiana, and that he possessed thousands of images of child pornography on various computer media devices, both in Lebanon and at his home in Rolling Springs.  The case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service, with the assistance of the Lebanon, Ind., Police Department, the Boone County, Ind., Prosecutors Office and the Russell County, Ky., Sheriffs Department. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve DeBrota of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Indiana and Trial Attorney Steve Grocki of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Criminal Division.
