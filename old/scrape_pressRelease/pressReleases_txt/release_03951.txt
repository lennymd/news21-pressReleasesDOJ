The Department of Justices Antitrust Division announced today that it will close its investigation into AT&Ts proposed $48 billion acquisition of DirecTV.This announcement follows a statement by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler that a final order approving the transaction has been circulated to the Commission.After an extensive investigation, we concluded that the combination of AT&Ts land-based internet and video business with DirecTVs satellite-based video business does not pose a significant risk to competition, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Antitrust Division. Our investigation benefitted from the Divisions close and constructive working relationship with the FCC. The commitments that the proposed FCC order includes, if adopted, will provide significant benefits to millions of subscribers.
