Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement on the departure of U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins:As United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne Tompkins has pursued the cause of justice with passion, with integrity, and with results, said Attorney General Holder. In her outstanding work on matters involving health care and financial fraud, she helped safeguard the well-being of the American people and bring wrongdoers to justice. Through her service on the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee, she proved herself to be an indispensable advisor on a range of vital issues. And with her efforts to protect civil rights and combat human trafficking, she stood up for innumerable men, women, and children who are too frequently overlooked and too often underserved. Over the course of her extraordinary career, Anne has never lost sight of the most vulnerable in her own community, and has spearheaded trailblazing projects to engage young people in the work of building a more just society, from anti-bullying efforts to leadership development. Through her work at all levels, she has served as an inspiring example to public servants throughout the country  including me. And while I will miss her distinguished leadership and wise counsel, I look forward to all that she will achieve in the next stage of her already remarkable career.
