The Justice Department filed a lawsuit today in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, against the owners and developers of 71 multifamily housing complexes in four states for failing to design and construct housing units and related facilities that are accessible to people with disabilities. The 71 complexes contain more than 2,500 ground-floor units that are required by the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to have accessible features. This is the governments first lawsuit in Alabama alleging violations of the FHA and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the design and construction of multi-family housing.Those who design and build multifamily housing complexes are required by federal laws that have been on the books for over two decades to provide accessible features for persons with disabilities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. Unlawful barriers deny Americans with disabilities the basic right to equal housing opportunities.The Fair Housing Act assures individuals with disabilities are provided accessible housing, said U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. My office is committed to taking action in cases where unlawful discrimination violates the access of those with disabilities to fair housing.The suit alleges that 36 properties in Alabama, 25 in Georgia, nine in North Carolina and one in Tennessee have significant barriers, including steps leading to building entrances, non-existent or excessively sloped pedestrian routes from apartment units to site amenities (e.g., picnic areas, dumpsters, clubhouse/leasing offices), insufficient maneuvering space in bathrooms and kitchens and inaccessible parking.The suit names as defendants Alabama-based developers Allan Rappuhn, Gateway Construction Corporation, Gateway Development Corporation and other affiliated companies. The suit seeks a court order requiring the defendants to bring properties into compliance with the FHA and the ADA, as well as monetary damages for persons harmed by the lack of accessibility and a payment of civil penalties to the United States. The complexes at issue, all of which were built with financial assistance from the federal governments Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program or other federal programs, are:Anyone with information about the inaccessible conditions at these properties should call the Justice Department at 1-800-896-7743and follow the prompts to enter mailbox number 2.NoneThe complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct.
