    WASHINGTON  Attorney General Eric Holder today commended teams from six cities across the country for developing comprehensive plans to reduce youth violence in their communities.   Mayors, U.S. Attorneys and other officials from Boston; Chicago; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Salinas, Calif.; and San Jose, Calif. presented their plans at the Summit on Preventing Youth Violence, April 4-5, in Washington, D.C. None     The summit is part of the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention launched by President Obama in October 2010.  The goal of the forum is to use multi-disciplinary partnerships, balanced approaches and data-driven strategies to address youth violence.  These six cities were selected based on need, geographic diversity, willingness and capacity to develop comprehensive plans. More localities are expected to join the forum.     In addition to the Department of Justice, the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy provide technical assistance to the forums participating cities.
