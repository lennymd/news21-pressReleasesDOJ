The Justice Department today opened a civil pattern-or-practice investigation into the Orange County District Attorneys Office and the Orange County Sheriffs Department, pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.NoneOrange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas requested that the Justice Department review his offices informant policies and practices and offered unfettered access to documents and personnel.A systematic failure to protect the right to counsel and to a fair trial makes criminal proceedings fundamentally unfair and diminishes the publics faith in the integrity of the justice system, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. Our investigation will examine the facts and evidence to determine whether the district attorneys office and sheriffs department engaged in a pattern or practice of violating these rights. We are grateful to District Attorney Rackauckas for the unrestricted access he has offered to provide.We appreciate the District Attorney's invitation to review his office's policies and practices, along with his assurance of unfettered access to documents and personnel in his office, said U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker of the Central District of California. We are confident that this investigation, and the cooperation being offered by the Orange County District Attorney's Office, will help restore public confidence in the integrity of the Orange County criminal justice system.None
