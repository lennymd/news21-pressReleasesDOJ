  The Presidents Task Force on Puerto Ricos Status held its first meeting today, continuing the important work of examining and reporting on the islands status question, but also expanding its focus to include matters affecting Puerto Ricos economic development. President Obama signed an Executive Order on Oct. 30, 2009, to both preserve the Task Forces original mission, and to provide advice and recommendations to the President and the Congress on policies that promote job creation, education, health care, clean energy, and economic development on the islands.  "President Obama recognizes the importance of both moving forward on the question of Puerto Ricos status, but also on working toward creating greater economic opportunities for all our citizens," said Task Force Co-Chair and White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Cecilia Muoz. "We look forward to continuing to work closely with officials and interested parties in Puerto Rico to build on the investments weve made through the Recovery Act, which are serving the people of Puerto Rico while creating and saving jobs in everything from community health centers to infrastructure projects."  Consistent with President Obamas commitment to responsive and accountable governing, the Task Force members voted to hold public hearings in Puerto Rico and on the mainland on the broad range of issues before them, and to seek the publics input.  "As the Task Force works to put in place a process for moving forward on these important policy matters, we will work diligently to engage the people of Puerto Rico and involve them in the process," added Task Force Co-Chair and Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli.  President Clinton originally established the Task Force when he signed Executive Order 13183 in December 2000. The Task Force is made up of designees of each member of the Presidents Cabinet and the Co-Chairs of the Presidents Interagency Group on Puerto Rico.
