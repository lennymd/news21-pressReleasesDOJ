      The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that Tomas Olazabal, of Fresh Meadows, N.Y., was arrested today following his indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on Aug. 8, 2013, on multiple tax crimes.       According to the indictment, Olazabal owned Tupac Construction Corp., a construction company in Fresh Meadows. As alleged in the indictment, Olazabal used check cashing services to cash a substantial number of checks paid to his construction company for services between 2007 and 2008. He concealed his check cashing activities from his tax return preparers. Accordingly, the gross receipts represented by the checks negotiated at the check cashers were not included as gross receipts on the companys tax returns.       The indictment alleges that Olazabal filed false 2007 and 2008 corporate income tax returns for Tupac. Olazabal faces a potential maximum sentence of six years in prison and a potential fine of up to $500,000.      A trial date has not been scheduled. An indictment merely alleges that a crime has been committed, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.      The case was investigated by IRS - Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Mark Kotila and Steve Descano of the Justice Departments Tax Division.
