      WASHINGTON  A federal court has permanently barred HedgeLender LLC from promoting a stock-loan tax scheme, the Justice Department announced today.  According to court findings, HedgeLender, which maintained offices in Philadelphia and Reston, Va., promoted a scheme purportedly allowing owners of appreciated stock to obtain cash through purported loans without reporting or paying tax on capital gains.       In entering a permanent injunction order against the firm, Judge T.S. Ellis III of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found that HedgeLender knowingly made false statements when it told potential customers that these HedgeLoan transactions were true loans secured by the customers stock.  In reality, the court found, the stock was sold immediately, and the funds provided to the customers were sales proceeds, not loan proceeds, and therefore subject to federal income tax on capital gains at the time of receipt.  According to the court, HedgeLender caused the sale of more than $268 million in securities through the HedgeLoan scheme, and it promoted the program even after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued two of its owners, who agreed to stop promoting a similar stock-loan product.
