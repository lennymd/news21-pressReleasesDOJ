NoneThe Civil Rights Division is committed to transformative reform at Rikers Island. We are deeply encouraged by this agreement in principle. We are also grateful to have worked with the U.S. Attorneys Office in this landmark civil rights case, a model for corrections reform throughout the country.NoneI have repeatedly made clear our unwavering commitment to enduring and enforceable reform at Rikers Island. Today, we have reached a groundbreaking agreement in principle with city officials, subject to ultimate approval by the court. This comprehensive framework requires the city to implement sweeping operational changes to fix a broken system and dismantle a decades-long culture of violence. Its ongoing implementation will be overseen by the court and an independent federal monitor. Federal prosecutors will remain vigilant to ensure that the Constitution protects each and every person within the walls of Rikers Island.
