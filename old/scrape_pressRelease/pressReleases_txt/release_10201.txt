  WASHINGTON  Attorney General Eric Holder announced today that President Obamas Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 budget proposal totaling $28.2 billion for the Department of Justice identifies $2.0 billion in efficiencies and savings while providing resources to strengthen national security, preserve the departments traditional missions, maintain prisons and detention, and assist our state, local and tribal law enforcement partners.   The request represents a 1.7percent increase in budget authority and an increase of 2,905 positions over the annualized FY 2011 Continuing Resolution (CR) level.      The Presidents budget request demonstrates a dedication to protecting our national security and a commitment to using every instrument of power to fight terrorism and keep America safe. This budget upholds the departments historic role in fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, and ensuring fairness in the marketplace, while responding to new challenges such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said Attorney General Holder. Given the current economic climate, this budget also identifies savings and efficiencies, while assuring that our resources will be devoted to our most critical mission areas.
