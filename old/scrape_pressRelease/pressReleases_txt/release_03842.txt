The Justice Department today released its first annual report following former Attorney General Eric Holders pledge in February 2014 to make public information related to law enforcement requests for information from, or records of, members of the news media.The report exemplifies the departments continuing commitment to increased transparency in its interactions with the media and to ensure that newsgathering activities by members of the news media are not unreasonably impaired by law enforcement activities. The report covers authorizations made during the 2014 calendar year and includes information provided by department divisions, including the U.S. Attorneys Offices.Todays report is an important step in the Justice Departments ongoing efforts to promote the freedom of the press, to keep the American people informed and to improve transparency and accountability regarding media-related process, said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. In addition to the statistical data former Attorney General Holder pledged to disclose, I have asked the department to provide information about each case or matter listed so that the public can better understand how the department is striking the proper balance among several vital interests: protecting national security, ensuring public safety, promoting effective law enforcement and the fair administration of justice and safeguarding the essential role of the free press in fostering government accountability and an open society.None
