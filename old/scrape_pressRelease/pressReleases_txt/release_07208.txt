  Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs Mary Lou Leary announced that Robert L. Listenbee Jr. has assumed the role as administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).   A highly respected public defender and juvenile justice system reformer, Listenbee began as OJJDP administrator Monday. Melodee Hanes, who has served as acting administrator since January 2012, will become OJJDPs principal deputy administrator.   It is a pleasure to welcome Bob Listenbee as OJJDPs new Administrator. Bob has been a champion for juvenile justice issues for many years, and did a tremendous job as co-chair of my task force on Children Exposed to Violence, said Attorney General Eric Holder. Im also deeply grateful to Melodee for her leadership and renewed focus on ensuring that children are treated fairly by the juvenile justice system. I look forward to continuing to work with both of these dedicated public servants as we carry on these critical efforts.   Bob Listenbee will bring tremendous leadership and experience to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in efforts to support positive youth development and keep our children safe from violence, said Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs Mary Lou Leary. In her time as acting administrator, Melodee Hanes successfully championed initiatives to reduce both childrens exposure to violence and the high volume of students entering the juvenile justice system following school suspensions. I thank them both and look forward to our work on these important issues together. None None None
