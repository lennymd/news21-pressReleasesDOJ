    Gordon Chavez, 35, a probation officer with the New Mexico Corrections Department of Probation and Parole, was arrested today in Albuquerque, N.M., on charges related to the sexual assault of a probationer whom he supervised.    According to court documents, Chavez was arrested for violating the civil rights of the victim by depriving her of her right to bodily integrity.  The complaint affidavit describes Chavezs escalating behavior, including Chavez commenting on the victims appearance, the clothes she was wearing and her sexual activity.  During office visits that the victim was required to attend, Chavez stared at the victims breasts while rubbing his own genital area through his pants. He also asked the victim to bring naked pictures of herself.  Ultimately, Chavez groped and fondled the victims breast under her clothes against her will.  Anyone with additional information is encouraged to call the Albuquerque Division of the FBI at (505) 889-1300.    Chavez will appear in federal court tomorrow for an initial appearance.  A complaint merely establishes probable cause. Chavez is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.       This case is being investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Baker for the District of New Mexico and Fara Gold of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
