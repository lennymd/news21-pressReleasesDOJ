A federal court has barred a Doral, Florida, man and his businesses from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction order, to which Eleuterio Almanzar consented, was entered by U.S. District Court Judge Jose E. Martinez of the Southern District of Florida. The governments complaint alleged that Almanzar prepared federal income tax returns for customers that understate the tax that is due or seek refunds larger than are appropriate. The injunction also bars Almanzars businesses, Almanzar Tax Accounting & Consulting Corp. and Almanzar Financial Services Corp., from continuing to prepare tax returns.NoneThe injunction requires Almanzar to provide a list of customers that identifies by name, social security number, address, e-mail address, telephone number and tax periods all persons for whom he has prepared federal tax returns or claims for refund since Jan. 1, 2009.For the returns Almanzar prepared since 2009, which the IRS examined, the average tax deficiency was $3,249 per return, according to the complaint. Given the number of returns Almanzar has prepared since 2009, he has potentially caused millions of dollars of harm to the U.S. Treasury.None
