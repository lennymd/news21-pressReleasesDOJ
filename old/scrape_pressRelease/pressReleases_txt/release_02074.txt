NoneOn Feb. 26, the government filed suit against Herard and alleged that returns prepared by Herard and his businesses have unlawfully understated customers income tax liabilities by creating or inflating deductions or fabricating business losses for non-existent businesses and have overstated refunds by falsely claiming tax credits, including education credits, fuel tax credits and medical and child care expenses for ineligible taxpayers who did not incur qualified expenses. The government alleged that, beginning with returns he prepared for the 2014 tax year, Herard prepared returns that falsely claimed the Premium Tax Credit, a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families with low or moderate income afford health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace aka the Exchange, by claiming it for customers who did not purchase health insurance through the Exchange.None
