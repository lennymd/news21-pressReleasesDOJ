The Justice Department today announced a settlement with the city ofSterling Heights, Michigan to resolve allegations that the city violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) in denying approval to allow the American Islamic Community Center, Inc. (AICC) to build a mosque in the city.The settlement, which must still be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, resolves a lawsuit the department filed in December 2016.A separate settlement resolving a similar lawsuit brought by the AICC against the city has also been submitted to the court for approval.The United States alleged that Sterling Heights discriminated against the AICC on the basis of religion when it denied the application to build a mosque.It further alleged that the denial imposed a substantial burden on the AICCs religious exercise.The AICC, currently located in Madison Heights, Michigan, sought to build in Sterling Heights because the location is more convenient for its members and its current space has become inadequate for its religious, educational and social needs.As part of the settlement, the city has agreed to permit the AICC to construct a mosque in the city.The city has also agreed to publicize its non-discrimination policies and practices, undergo training on the requirements of RLUIPA, and report periodically to the Justice Department.
