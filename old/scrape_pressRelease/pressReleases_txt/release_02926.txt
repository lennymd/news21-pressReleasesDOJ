The Justice Department announced that the corporate owner and agent of Gentle Manor Estates have agreed to pay $130,000 to settle a Justice Department lawsuit alleging familial status discrimination. The settlement must still be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.The lawsuit, filed in May 2015, alleged that Gentle Manor Estates LLC and John Townsend violated the Fair Housing Act by maintaining and enforcing a discriminatory policy of refusing to allow families with children to live at Gentle Manor Estates, a 173-lot mobile home park in Crown Point, Indiana. The allegations were based on evidence generated by the departments Fair Housing Testing Program, in which individuals pose as renters to gather information about possible discriminatory practices.The Fair Housing Act guarantees families with children the right to choose a home without facing unlawful barriers of discrimination, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will continue its vigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act to ensure that equal access to housing  a bedrock of the American dream  remains a reality for all families in our country.NoneNoneNone
