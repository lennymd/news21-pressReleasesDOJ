  Kelly Doll, formerly a VIP host at the Pure Nightclub located within the Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to one count of filing a false federal income tax return for the 2006 tax year, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.   U.S.   District Court Judge Miranda Du presided over the plea hearing.   According to information disclosed at the plea hearing, during the years 2005, 2006 and 2007, some of Pures patrons made cash payments to Pure door personnel and VIP hosts to bypass the general admissions line and to obtain more desirable seating.   This money was collected, pooled and generally distributed on a weekly basis to the door personnel and VIP hosts, as well as to managers of Pure.   Distributions from this tip pool comprised the bulk of Dolls compensation during the time he worked at the nightclub. Doll concealed large amounts of this income from the IRS.   Pures former managing owner, Steve Davidovici, has also pleaded guilty to tax fraud for failing to report income earned at Pure, as have Dolls former co-workers, Mikel Hasen, Ali (Sean) Olyaie and Richard Chu.   Each of these individuals likewise admitted filing false federal income tax returns for 2006.   Dolls sentencing is set for Sept. 24, 2012.   Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended the efforts of special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Christopher J. Maietta and Joseph A. Rillotta, who prosecuted the case. None
