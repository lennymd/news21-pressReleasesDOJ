Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement regarding the shooting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana:I have been briefed on the ongoing situation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I will continue to monitor events throughout the day. Although information about this morning's incident is still coming in, we do know that at least three officers are feared dead and several others are wounded. Agents from the FBI and ATF are on the scene, and the Department of Justice will make available victim services and federal funding support, and will provide investigative assistance to the fullest extent possible.For the second time in two weeks, multiple law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty. There is no place in the United States for such appalling violence, and I condemn these acts in the strongest possible terms. I pledge the full support of the Department of Justice as the investigation unfolds. Our hearts and prayers are with the fallen and wounded officers, their families, and the entire Baton Rouge community in this extraordinarily difficult time.
