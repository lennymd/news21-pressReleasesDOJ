None  The three seized domain names  applanet.net, appbucket.net and snappzmarket.com  are in the custody of the federal government. Visitors to the sites will now find a seizure banner that notifies them that the domain name has been seized by federal authorities and educates them that willful copyright infringement is a federal crime.  Cracking down on piracy of copyrighted works  including popular apps  is a top priority of the Criminal Division, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. Software apps have become an increasingly essential part of our nations economy and creative culture, and the Criminal Division is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect the creators of these apps and other forms of intellectual property from those who seek to steal it.NoneNone
