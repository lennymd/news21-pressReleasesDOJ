None  The agreement between the Justice Department and the California Secretary of State provides remedial options to afford affected military and overseas voters sufficient opportunity to receive, cast and return their ballots in time to be counted. Under the agreement, affected voters will be notified of their options to receive and return their ballots by electronic or other expedited methods, and they will be offered the option of returning their ballots by express delivery at no cost to the voter. The agreement recognizes the steps some counties already took to utilize express delivery for ballots that were not sent at least 45 days prior to the election.  Members of our armed forces, their families and overseas citizens are entitled to a complete and meaningful opportunity to vote, and the Justice Department is committed to seeking full access to the ballot box for all voters  regardless of where they are on Election Day, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The California Secretary of State worked cooperatively with the department and agreed to implement measures that will ensure Californias military and overseas voters will have the opportunity to fully participate in Junes primary election and future federal elections.  Our fine men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices serving our nation every day, said Benjamin B. Wagner, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California. This agreement ensures that military voters, as well as U.S. citizens who are overseas, need not sacrifice their right to vote.NoneNone
