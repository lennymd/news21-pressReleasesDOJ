NoneNone    A federal court has entered a permanent injunction ordering ITS Financial LLC, the parent company of the Instant Tax Service franchise, to cease operating, the Justice Department announced today. The injunction order, which was signed yesterday by Judge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, also bars Fesum Ogbazion, the sole owner and CEO of ITS Financial, from operating or being involved with any business relating to tax-return preparation. The court issued the order following a two-week trial in Cincinnati in June 2013.     Instant Tax Service, which is based in Dayton, Ohio, claimed to be the fourth-largest tax-preparation firm in the nation. According to the court, ITS Financial had about 150 franchisees that filed over 100,000 tax returns each year in 2011 and 2012. Two other entities owned by Ogbazion, Tax Tree LLC and TCA Financial LLC, were also defendants in the case and were also ordered to cease operating.      The court found that Ogbazion and his defendant companies had: NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone       The court credited an IRS study concluding that the tax harm caused by Instant Tax Service franchisees in five cities in a single tax-filing season was between $10 million and $25 million.        Defendants harm to the public is extensive and egregious, indeed appalling, the court stated. This is especially so given the nature of Instant Tax Services core customer  the working poor  who are particularly vulnerable to [the] Defendants fraudulent practices.       The court further stated: Defendants repeated attempts at trial and in argument to downplay the gravity of their lawlessness was stunning. The court concludes that even today [the] Defendants have not fully recognized their culpability. Ultimately, the nature, scope and gravity of [the] Defendants offenses, and the unrepentant attitude toward their commission, demonstrate the necessity for a complete injunction putting the Defendants permanently out of business. None     We are gratified by the courts decision, which serves to protect hard-working taxpayers who were targeted by Instant Tax Service, and also safeguards all honest taxpayers from the harm done by fraudulent tax filings, said Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally of the Justice Departments Tax Division. As described by the court, this company grew large through abhorrent means  filing returns without customer authorization, forging customer signatures, pushing fraudulent loan products, and much more. As the courts decision recognizes, a business model based on false and fraudulent conduct cannot be allowed to prevail.     The court's decision sends a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse the public trust provided to the tax preparer community, said Acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. Those who deceive their customers and defraud the U.S. Treasury will face swift legal action that puts an end totheir corrosive conduct."      Assistant Attorney General Keneally thanked former and current Tax Division trial attorneys Nathan Clukey, Sean Green, Russell Edelstein, Jose Olivera and Gregory Van Hoey, along with paralegal Mahana Karimi, for their efforts on the case. She also thanked the many IRS attorneys and agents who participated in the investigation. None
