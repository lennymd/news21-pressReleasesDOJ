Judge Boyle ordered that Richardson surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on March 6, 2012.According to an order filed that set conditions for his release, Richardson is a resident of Mansfield, Tex.  In handing down the sentence, Judge Boyle commented that Richardson was a former IRS employee who used his inside knowledge of IRS operations to commit his crime.
