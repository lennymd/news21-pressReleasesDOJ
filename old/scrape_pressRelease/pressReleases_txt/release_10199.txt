NoneNone    The FBI appreciates the efforts, time and expertise of this group of highly respected professionals of the Academy.  The Academy was asked by the FBI to conduct an independent review in appreciation of the significance of the anthrax investigation and the groundbreaking nature of the science involved and its role in resolving the case. We commend the committee formed by the Academy for a report that provides valuable guidance and better prepares the FBI to respond to attacks of a similar nature in the future.        Among other findings, the committee confirmed the value of the emerging field of microbial forensics, which proved significant in solving this case.  This scientific technique established a critical lead as to the origins of the anthrax used in the attacks, allowing investigators to focus investigative resources and efforts.  Ultimately, the late Dr. Bruce Ivins was determined to be the perpetrator of the deadly mailings.  The FBI and Department of Justice were preparing for prosecution at the time of Dr. Ivins death.       As the Report recognizes, this was an investigation of almost unprecedented scope, complexity, and duration.  Its origins were in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks when the FBI was unsure of possible links to those attacks and concerned about follow-on attacks.  The investigation necessarily moved at a rapid pace, proceeding on two parallel fronts: a traditional investigation, involving tracking leads and conducting interviews, and a scientific one, led by the FBI Lab and included scientists from outside of law enforcement.  From the outset, the scientific and traditional investigations were mutually reinforcing.  Each helped guide and direct the other.  The report notes the complexity of the parallel tracks of the investigation and how aspects of each track informed decisions to proceed with or abandon particular lines of the investigation.       As the report notes, one of the most significant scientific approaches undertaken in the case  the field of microbial forensics  was being developed as the investigation unfolded.  While the biological and chemical analytical methods applied in the investigation were neither new nor unique, the application was both innovative and groundbreaking.  The committees findings highlight the emerging role that microbial forensics played in this investigation and its promise for future investigations.  The Report also recognized the FBIs unprecedented efforts to form outside partnerships within the scientific community and the value that their expertise can lend to a criminal investigation of this magnitude.   None     Over the course of the investigation, the FBI and the Postal Inspection Service devoted 600,000 investigator work hours to the case and assigned 17 Special Agents to a Task Force, along with 10 U.S. Postal Inspectors.  The investigation spanned six continents; involved over 10,000 witness interviews, 80 searches, 26,000 e-mail reviews, and analyses of 4 million megabytes of computer memory; and resulted in the issuance of 5,750 grand jury subpoenas.  Additionally, 29 government, university, and commercial laboratories assisted in conducting the scientific analyses that were an important aspect of the investigation.     The FBI believes that todays Report will increase the publics understanding of the exhaustive effort that resolved one of the most extensive investigations in the history of the FBI. None
