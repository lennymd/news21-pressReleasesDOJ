None  The civil injunction suit names three men: Daniel Stafford of Gaithersburg, Md.; Fred R. Wahler, Jr. of Philadelphia; and William Chapman of Great Falls, Va. Stafford and Wahler allegedly own Philadelphia-based defendant HedgeLender LLC. Chapman allegedly owns the remaining two companies named in the complaint, Alexander Capital Markets LLC and Alexander Financial LLC, both based in Great Falls.  According to the government complaint, the defendants promote and operate the HedgeLoan scheme, in which customers are falsely told that they can receive tax free cash for their securities in the form of a "loan," when in reality the monies received are sales proceeds subject to federal income tax on capital gains at the time of receipt. One couple from Michigan cited in the complaint allegedly used the defendants HedgeLoan scheme to dispose of more than $4 million in stock through 25 separate transactions. According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service audited the couples 2005 federal income tax return and found that they had under-reported their income by $3,662,528 as a result of their participation in the scheme. The complaint further alleges that the couple allegedly agreed to pay an additional $616,984 in income tax for 2005.  The suit claims that in virtually every case, the defendants simply sold the customers securities on receipt, remitted up to 90 percent of the sales proceeds to the customer as the "loan," and retained the remaining sales proceeds for themselves and the other parties who facilitated the scheme. This allegedly left defendants without the assets necessary to return every customers so-called "collateral" if requested at the end of the purported "loan" term. As early as 2007, defendants allegedly lacked the funds to return all customers securities who requested them  yet they continued to promote and operate the HedgeLoan scheme and related schemes.None
