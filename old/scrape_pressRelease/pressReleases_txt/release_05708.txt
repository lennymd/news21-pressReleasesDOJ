  Eric Anderson, of Dix Hills, New  York, pleaded guilty today in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District  of New York to the willful failure to collect and pay over employment taxes, the  Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.   According to court documents,  Anderson owned three construction companies located in Dix Hills: Anderson  Framing, Anderson Enterprise and Anderson Trim Specialty.  Anderson corruptly  endeavored to obstruct the IRS between 2006 and 2008 by using a check cashing  service to cash over $10.5 million of gross receipts checks paid to his  construction companies.  He concealed his check cashing activities from his tax  return preparer so that the income was not included on the companies tax  returns.  Anderson paid his employees in cash while failing to collect and pay  over employment taxes to the IRS.  He also diverted cash receipts earned by his  companies for his own personal use.  Finally, after learning of the criminal  investigation, Anderson shredded business records and lied to IRS investigators  about his use of the check cashing service.  The estimated tax loss resulting  from Andersons activities is between $1 and $2.5 million.   Anderson faces a statutory  potential maximum sentence of five years in prison and a potential fine of up to  $250,000.  U.S. District Judge Arthur Spatt set sentencing for Sept. 19,  2014.   The case was investigated by  IRS-Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Mark  Kotila and Jeffrey Bender of the Justice Departments Tax Division.
