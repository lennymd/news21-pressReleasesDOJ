Two federal indictments were unsealed yesterday in the Southern District of Florida charging two Miami area tax return preparers with aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal income tax returns, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Justice Departments Tax Division.On April 14, Noe Mompoint, of Southwest Ranches, Florida, was charged with 14 counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal income tax returns. Lucvens Francois, of Aventura, Florida, was charged in a separate indictment with 19 counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal income tax returns. Both defendants surrendered yesterday and had their initial appearances in court.According to the allegations in the indictments, Mompoint owned and operated the Tax Resource Center, a tax preparation business located in Miami. Mompoint filed tax returns for clients that reported fraudulent first-time homebuyer credits. Francois owned and operated a branch office of the Tax Resource Center, also located in the Miami area. Francois filed tax returns for clients that reported fraudulent first-time homebuyer credits and returns that claimed a variety of other false items, including false education credits, false business losses and false itemized deductions.If convicted, Mompoint and Francois each face a statutory maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on each count.An indictment is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceeding.Acting Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo commended the special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Trial Attorneys Charles M. Edgar Jr. and Jason H. Poole of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case.
