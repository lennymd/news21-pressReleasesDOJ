      WASHINGTON  The United States has sued Judy Grace Sellers to bar her from promoting an alleged scheme involving fraudulent tax refund claims, the Justice Department announced today.  The governments amended complaint for a civil injunction alleges that Sellers, of Chipley, Fla., helps her customers create false documents to support a fraudulent Secured Party Creditor argument.  According to the lawsuit, this frivolous argument maintains that the federal government has created a strawman for each U.S. citizen and an account exists at the Treasury Department for the strawman.  Sellers allegedly assists her customers in preparing documents to obtain funds from their supposed Treasury accounts.       According to the amended complaint, this scheme, also called the commercial redemption scheme, involves Sellerss customers filing fraudulent tax returns with false Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms 1099-OID.  The government alleges that the forms falsely claim huge amounts of tax withholding and that the returns claim large tax refunds based on the false withholding amounts.  None None
