NoneedX was created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University in 2012 as a nonprofit platform for select universities to offer MOOCs to the world. The consortiums 36 charter members include Berkeley, Georgetown, Dartmouth, Caltech, the Sorbonne and Peking University, in addition to Harvard and MIT. Today, edX has approximately 60 university and institutional members providing over 450 courses to over 3,000,000 learners. The courses are offered largely for free in subject matters as varied as business, computer sciences, hard sciences, food and nutrition and social sciences.NoneThe four-year agreement requires edX to:Massive open online courses have the potential to increase access to high-quality education for people facing income, distance, and other barriers, but only if they are truly open to everyone, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Gupta. This landmark agreement is far-reaching in ensuring that individuals with disabilities will have an equal opportunity to independently and conveniently access quality higher education online. edX is to be commended for working with the Justice Department to take such steps.Critical portions of education are moving online, in tandem with the rest of our social experience, said U.S. Attorney Ortiz. This new, educational online world readily can, and should be, built from the outset in a way that does not discriminate against those with disabilities.Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of places of public accommodations. Title III of the ADA also requires public accommodations to take necessary steps to ensure individuals with disabilities are not excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, such as accurate captioning of audible materials and labeling of visual materials. The Justice Department has long considered Title III and its implementing regulation to apply to the online services and communications of public accommodations.NoneNone
