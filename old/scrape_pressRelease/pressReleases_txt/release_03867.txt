Victims Included McConnell Senate Committee Defendant Admits to Purchasing Vacation Condominiums, Luxury Automobiles and Jewelry with the Stolen FundsThe former vendor for multiple local, state and federal campaigns, political action committees (PACs) and non-profit organizations throughout the United States, including the McConnell Senate Committee pleaded guilty to three charges of mail fraud today in U.S. District Court for stealing more than $1.1 million in contributions and donations intended for committees and organizations announced U.S. Attorney John E. Kuhn, Jr. of the Western District of Kentucky.Samuel Pate, while working in a position of trust for political campaigns, political action committees and non-profit groups, stole more than a million dollars, said U.S. Attorney Kuhn, Jr. These organizations  as well as earnest citizens trying to participate in the political process through contributions  were unknowingly victimized by Pates selfishness and avarice. He used the stolen funds for personal expenses, vacation homes, luxury vehicles and jewelry. Thus far, due to the efforts of my office and the FBI, nearly half of all the stolen funds have been recovered and are being returned to the victim organizations.Mr. Pate intentionally diverted campaign contributions and political action committee donations for his own personal financial gain, said Special Agent in Charge Howard S. Marshall of the Louisville Division for the FBI. As such, Mr. Pate's actions subverted the political process by denying individuals their right to participate in the political process. In a democracy, there is simply no greater right than to elect our political leaders. Anyone attempting to corrupt the political process, in this way or any other, will be investigated as a top priority for our office."Samuel K.
