The Department of Justice today filed a Statement of Interest inYoung Americas Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans v. Janet Napolitano. The plaintiffs, Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) and Young Americas Foundation (YAF), allege that the University of California, Berkeley, enforced a double standard when applied to free speech. BCR alleges that UC Berkeley applied a more rigorous and highly discretionary set of rules to their organization compared to other campus groups, especially with respect to high-profile campus speakers.  The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit as a result of excessive hurdles BCR faced in bringing speakers of their choice onto campus. They allege that UC Berkeleys High Profile Speaker Policy and Major Events Policy violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Berkeleys High-Profile Speaker Policy granted administrators unfettered discretion to decide which speakers are subject to arduous curfews, prohibitive security costs, or undesirable venues. In one instance, administratorswho had full discretion to determine who constituted a high-profile speakerestablished a 3:00 pm curfew that conflicted with class times.  While the plaintiffs attempted to book speakers under the restrictions of the High-Profile Speaker Policy, a former president of Mexico and a former White House adviser were hosted at the University, but University administrators did not apply the High-Profile Speakers Policy to those events. In filing the Statement of Interest, Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand provided the following statement: This Department of Justice will not stand by idly while public universities violate students constitutional rights.
