None  Prior to 2006, the city of Indianapolis and its 800,000 residents experienced Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) totaling approximately 7.8 billion gallons per year.   Combined sewer systems, which have not been constructed for decades in the United States, carry both sanitary wastewater (domestic sewage from homes, as well as industrial and commercial wastewater), and storm water runoff (from rainfall or snowmelt) in a single system of pipes to a publicly owned treatment works.   A consent decree approved by a federal court in 2006 required the city to construct 31 CSO control measures, including a 24-million gallon capacity shallow interceptor sewer, to reduce the citys overflows to approximately 642 million gallons per year.   Those improvements were expected to cost approximately $1.73 billion over a 20-year period.   After the 2006 consent decree was approved, the city undertook additional engineering studies of its system and ultimately proposed a number of changes to its system to make it more efficient and to further reduce the numbers and volumes of overflows.   The first change, which was approved in a 2009 amendment to the 2006 consent decree, eliminated the shallow interceptor in favor of a 54-million gallon, 25 mile long Deep Rock Tunnel Connector.    None None  Only under unique circumstances would we modify the terms of a settlement, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice.   The proposed modifications will benefit the environment and reduce costs for the city of Indianapolis. In my view, this is a classic win-win NoneNone None
