In addition, 80 videos of child pornography were recovered.None      This case is the result of a joint investigation by the Folsom, Calif., Police Department; the El Dorado County, Calif., Sheriffs Department; the FBIs Cyber Crime Task Force and CEOS High Technology Investigative Unit.   The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Prince for the Eastern District of California and CEOS Trial Attorney Keith Becker of the Justice Departments Criminal Division.
