A Georgia man pleaded guilty today to operating an odometer fraud scheme involving over 100 vehicles, the Department of Justice announced today. Paul Robinson, 37, of Lawrenceville, Georgia, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and odometer tampering. We buy vehicles to help assist us in many aspects of our lives, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler of the Justice Departments Civil Division.No consumer makes such a significant purchase lightly and we have to be able to trust that a dealer is not selling one car and actually supplying a vastly inferior automobile paired with falsified title documents.We are committed to prosecuting individuals who break that trust by rolling back odometers and passing off phony title.Robinson owned and operated Affordable Auto Body Repair, a repair shop and licensed salvage vehicle dealer located in Chesapeake, Virginia. Robinson purchased older vehicles, many of which had been involved in accidents, from an automobile auction specializing in vehicles from insurance companies. On over 100 of these vehicles, Robinson altered or replaced the odometer to reflect a false, lower mileage. He then obtained fraudulent Virginia motor vehicle titles with mileage readings matching the false, lower mileage on the new odometer, and passed these falsified title documents on to the auto purchasers. NoneThis case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys John W. Burke and Jacqueline Blaesi-Freed of the Civil Divisions Consumer Protection Branch with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Salsbury of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.NoneNone
