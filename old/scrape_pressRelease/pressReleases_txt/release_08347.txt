None None   As we remember and honor his many achievements and contributions, our thoughts and prayers are with the Katzenbach family. Although Nick Katzenbach will be sorely missed, there is much to celebrate in the life he lived, in the example he set, and in the inspiration he will continue to provide  for me, for my colleagues across the Department of Justice, and for the Nation he was so proud to serve.
