  "The study released today shines a light on a problem too often in the dark  youth violence. Schools should be safe havens where young people can learn and prosper, and anything less than that is unacceptable. Weve met with students affected by the fatal beating of Derrion Albert in Chicago and brought teens struggling with the issue of dating violence here to Washington. Through these conversations, research like the study released today, and an intense focus on vital policy issues, we are gathering the tools necessary to address this problem effectively. In the coming year,the Departments of Education and Justicewillwork side-by-side with ourlocal and community partners, bringing all of our combined resources to bear,to help stem the tide of youth violence.  "Eradicating youth violence is a priority of this administration and a priority of both these agencies. As cabinet officials, as concerned citizens and most importantly, as fathers, we are committed to continuing our work to eliminate youth violence."None
