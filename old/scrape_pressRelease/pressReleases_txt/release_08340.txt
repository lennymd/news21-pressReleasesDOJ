In addition, on March 21, 2012, Lobbins pleaded guilty to escaping from the custody of the Attorney General on Nov. 30, 2011, while being housed at the Robertson County, Tenn., jail.  According to evidence presented at trial, Battle, leader of the Traveling Vice Lords, holding the rank of Five Star Universal Elite and controlling the Middle and East Tennessee regions, and Lobbins, a member of the Traveling Vice Lords, shot and killed Harris on Feb. 10, 2008. Battle believed that Harris, who was a member of the Mickey Cobras, a gang aligned with the Vice Lords, had made statements regarding Battle having some involvement in the death of Donnell Valentine, aka Hitman, the leader of the Conservative Vice Lords in Murfreesboro, Tenn. Subsequently, Battle lured Harris to OCharleys, a restaurant on Bell Road in Nashville, under the guise of a drug transaction. Lobbins accompanied Battle to the location.
