      WASHINGTON  A federal jury this week found that the Clean Water Act applied to the filling of wetlands and other waters at two properties in Carver, Mass., owned by Charles Johnson, Genelda Johnson, Francis Vaner (Van) Johnson, and Johnson Cranberries Limited Partnership (the Johnsons), announced Assistant Attorney General Ignacia S. Moreno of the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz and EPA Regional Administer H. Curtis Spaulding.       The Johnsons filled and altered approximately 46.1 acres of wetlands and other waters in order to construct cranberry bogs and associated structures.        The suit was originally brought by the United States in 1999 at the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce a provision of the Clean Water Act which prohibits the discharge of dredged and fill material into waters of the United States, which include certain wetlands, without first obtaining a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   None     The prosecution of the case was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney George B. Henderson of the U.S. Attorneys Office in the District of Massachusetts, Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division Attorney Jered J. Lindsay, with assistance from EPA Enforcement Counsel Margery Adams and Christine Foot.
