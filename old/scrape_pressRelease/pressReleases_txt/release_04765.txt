The Justice Department announced today that it has asked a federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, to permanently bar a Silver Spring, Maryland, tax preparer, doing business as Eplanet, Eplanet LLP, Eplanet Corp., and Eplanete Corp., from preparing tax returns for others.The government also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to prevent Komi Gbotcho from filing any returns for the 2014 tax year.According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that Gbotcho, through Eplanet, has prepared more than 1,300 tax returns for the 2010 through 2013 tax years. The suit alleges that Gbotcho prepared returns claiming false or inflated deductions, such as deductions for personal property rental expenses, unreimbursed employee business expenses and home improvement expenses, without some customers knowledge. The suit contends that the false and inflated deductions generated larger refunds for Gbotchos customers than they were entitled to receive, and that the losses to the U.S. Treasury could amount to as much as $3.4 million.None
