    The Justice Department, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Maryland and the FBI announced that Josh Hummer, a sergeant at the Roxbury Correctional Institution (RCI) in Hagerstown, Md., was convicted today by a federal jury of obstructing justice during the investigation of an assault against an inmate.      Hummer faces a statutory maximum of 20 years when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar. The assault against the inmate occurred on March 9, 2008.     In related cases, Judge Bredar has accepted guilty pleas from former RCI officers Ryan Lohr, Dustin Norris, Tyson Hinckle, Reginald Martin, Michael Morgan, Edwin Stigile, Lanny Harris, Philip Mayo, Jeremy McCusker, Walter Steele, Keith Morris and Robert Harvey. Two former RCI officers previously pleaded guilty in state court.      Two current or former RCI officers still face federal charges in connection with this incident. The officers, who are presumed innocent until proven guilty, will stand trial in February.      The investigation by the Fredrick Resident Agency of the FBI is ongoing. The case is being prosecuted by Special Litigation Counsel Forrest Christian and Trial Attorneys Christine Siscaretti and Sanjay Patel for the Civil Rights Division.
