Today Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the following statement applauding the House of Representatives for passing three significant Anti-Human Trafficking bills:There is simply no way to overstate the horrific nature of enticement, kidnapping, and human trafficking. It is an absolute priority of President Trump and the Department of Justice to make those that seek to profit off the exploitation of others feel the weight of swift and certain justice. I am therefore extremely encouraged by the actions of Congress today in passing legislation aimed at stopping this scourge and commend all those that supported these bills.BACKGROUNDThe Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection ActThe Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking ActThe Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act
