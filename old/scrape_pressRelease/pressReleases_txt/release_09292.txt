SAN ANTONIO  A former Bexar County, Texas, Sheriffs Office deputy pleaded guilty today in federal court in San Antonio to civil rights charges related to the use of excessive force against a detainee, the Justice Department announced. Raymond Quintero, 33, pleaded guilty to willfully depriving a detainee of his constitutional right to be free from excessive force amounting to punishment. A law enforcement uniform does not give an officer the right to violate the civil rights of those under his supervision, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute those law enforcement officials who violate the law and the public trust. During his guilty plea, Quintero, admitted that on Oct. 8, 2007, he was working as a detention officer at the Bexar County Adult Detention Center and was responsible for the custody, control, care and safety of inmates. On that date, Quintero threw a detainee against a closet wall. Quintero admitted that his conduct constituted excessive force and violated the detainees civil rights. Sentencing has been scheduled for Dec. 29, 2011. Quintero faces up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. This case was investigated by Special Agent Mirella Rodriguez of the San Antonio Division of the FBI with assistance from the Bexar County Sheriffs Office, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Baumann of the Western District of Texas and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Christopher Lomax.
