A federal court has ordered a Baltimore-area importer of marble and granite to pay its payroll taxes as they become due, the Justice Department announced today. Judge Ellen L. Hollander of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a permanent injunction requiring Alexander Stone Inc. d/b/a MMG Marble & Granite and its owners, Soultana Efthimiadis and Kyriakos Efthimiadis, to pay their federal payroll tax liabilities as they became due and owing.According to the United States complaint, Alexander Stone has repeatedly failed to make timely and adequate federal employment tax deposits since 2008 and has amassed substantial employment tax liabilities. The defendants agreed to entry of the injunction but did not admit or deny the substance of the allegations in the United States civil complaint.Under the terms of the injunction, the business must deposit its payroll taxes and file its employment tax returns on a timely basis. The defendants are also required to notify the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the requisite tax deposits have been made and tell the IRS if they begin operating any new business. The defendants are precluded from assigning property or making any payments to other creditors until the employment tax and withholding liabilities are paid. The injunction is effective immediately and will ensure that Alexander Stone stays current on its federal employment tax obligations. Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Tax Division thanked IRS Field Collection and its revenue officer for investigating and preparing the civil case.
