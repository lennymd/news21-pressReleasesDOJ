None None       According to court documents, Ringo and Dugger were stationed at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Shank, a U.S. Army installation in the Logar Province of Eastern Afghanistan.  FOB Shank supports U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in various ways, including through fuel receipt and redistribution.  More specifically, the Army stores large quantities of fuel at FOB Shank and redistributes that fuel to installations in the surrounding area through government contractors.  Duggers responsibilities included supervision of FOB Shanks fuel redistribution process.        In his guilty plea, Dugger admitted that between January and February 2010 he aided and abetted a co-conspirators solicitation and acceptance of more than $400,000 in bribes from a government contractor, all in exchange for his co-conspirators creation and submission of fraudulent paperwork permitting that contractor to steal fuel from FOB Shank.  Dugger also admitted that he helped his co-conspirator conceal the money in various locations in and around FOB Shank.  The total value of the fuel stolen during the course of the scheme was at least $1.39 million.        At sentencing, Dugger faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a fine of $250,000; twice the gross gain or loss from the scheme; or three times the value of the payments solicited or received.  Duggers sentencing is currently scheduled for Nov. 5, 2010, at 9:00 a.m.  None       The NPFTF, created in October 2006 by the Department of Justice, was designed to promote the early detection, identification, prevention and prosecution of procurement fraud associated with the increase in government contracting activity for national security and other government programs.
