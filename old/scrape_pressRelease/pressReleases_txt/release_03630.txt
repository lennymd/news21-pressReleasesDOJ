Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced today that the Justice Department will launch a new collaborative strategy to more closely partner with businesses in intellectual property enforcement efforts and will award over $3.2 million to ten jurisdictions to support state and local task forces in the training, prevention, enforcement and prosecution of intellectual property theft and infringement crimes.The digital age has revolutionized how we share information, store data, make purchases and develop products, requiring law enforcement to strengthen our defenses against cybercrime  one of my top priorities as Attorney General, said Attorney General Lynch. High-profile instances of hacking  even against large companies like Sony and Target  have demonstrated the seriousness of the threat all business face and have underscored the potential for sophisticated adversaries to inflict real and lasting harm.The new FBI collaborative strategy builds upon the work previously done by the department while also working with industry partners to make enforcement efforts more effective. As part of the strategy, the FBI will partner with third-party marketplaces to ensure they have the right analytical tools and techniques to combat intellectual property concerns on their websites. The bureau also will serve as a bridge between brand owners and third-party marketplaces in an effort to mitigate instances of the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of counterfeit products. This new strategy will help law enforcement and companies better identify, prioritize and disrupt the manufacturing, distribution, advertising and sale of counterfeit products. Crimes will then be investigated by the FBI and other partners of the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center and finally prosecuted by the Department of Justice.Additionally, the Office of Justice Programs Intellectual Property Enforcement Program (IPEP) will award $3.2 million in grants to aid state and local law enforcement in addressing intellectual property crimes.Local award recipients announced today include the following:City of Austin Police Department$400,000City of Hartford Police Department$399,545Cook County State Attorney's Office$400,000Baltimore County Police Department$120,174North Carolina Department of Secretary of State$367,076New Jersey State Police$269,619City of Phoenix Police Department$253,129City of Portland Police Department$373,569Virginia State Police$253,128City of San Antonio Police Department$400,000Since IPEPs establishment in 2009, the department has invested nearly $14.8 million for 41 task forces across the country.

Faulty and counterfeit products are often sold to unsuspecting consumers and pose a severe threat to their health and safety. In a few circumstances, these activities are used to fund dangerous or violent criminal enterprises or organized crime networks.
