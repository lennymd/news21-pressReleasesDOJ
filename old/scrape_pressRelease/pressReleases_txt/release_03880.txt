The states of West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania are co-plaintiffs in todays settlement. The companies will also pay a $2 million civil penalty.This joint enforcement effort, with three states, has resulted in a settlement that will require changes that will benefit the health and environment of Appalachian communities for many years to come, said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Environment and Natural Resources Division. Under the terms of the agreement, Arch Coal and its subsidiaries will pay a significant penalty, improve their pollution control systems and provide for independent monitoring and data tracking that will make it a better company and a better neighbor to these communities.Businesses have an obligation to ensure that their operations dont threaten the communities they serve, especially those that are overburdened by or more vulnerable to pollution, said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. This settlement will prevent future environmental and public health risks by making sure these companies comply with federal and state clean water laws.Todays settlement is good news for water quality in the Appalachian region, especially people living in vulnerable and underserved communities, said Regional Administrator Shawn M. Garvin for EPA. It represents an important next step forward by requiring these companies to take necessary actions to reduce pollution from their mining operations.In addition to paying the penalty, under the proposed consent decree the companies must implement measures to ensure compliance and prevent future Clean Water Act violations, which will help protect communities overburdened by pollution, including:Developing and implementing a compliance management system.Periodic internal and third-party environmental compliance audits.Maintaining a data management system to track violations, water sampling data and compliance efforts.Providing training for environmental managers and others responsible for the consent decree.Paying escalating stipulated penalties if violations continue to occur.The government complaint filed concurrently with the settlement alleged that in the last six years, ICG operations have violated discharge limits for aluminum, manganese, iron and total suspended solids in their state-issued National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits on more than 1,200 occasions, resulting in over 8,900 days of violations. Of those violations, 700 have been previously resolved by state enforcement actions in Kentucky and West Virginia.EPA discovered the violations through inspections of ICG facilities and projects, reviewing various information provided by the companies and coordinating with the affected state governments.The proposed consent decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and approval by the federal court.NoneNone
