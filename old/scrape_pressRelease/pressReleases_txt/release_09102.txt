      WASHINGTON  Wesley William Brandt of Davenport, Fla., was sentenced today to 90 years in prison and a lifetime of supervised release for production of child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Robert E. ONeill and Susan McCormick, Special Agent-in-Charge for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).       Brandt was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich in Tampa, Fla.      In June of 2011, Brandt, 46, pleaded guilty to three counts of production of child pornography.  According to court documents and proceedings, in February 2008, Brandt, posing as a 17-year-old boy, began communicating online with a 13-year-old girl from Colorado.  During these communications and through the use of other online personas, Brandt threatened and coerced the Colorado victim to produce sexually explicit photographs of herself and her 6-year-old sister.  Specifically, Brandt threatened to create a public website and post sexually explicit images of the victim if she did not send him additional sexually explicit images of herself.  Brandt was also introduced to the 13-year-old female cousin of the Colorado victim and similarly threatened and coerced her to produce sexually explicit photographs of herself.  A subsequent search of Brandts home yielded computers and computer storage devices containing multiple images of child pornography.    This case was investigated by   ICEs HSI  .  This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Andrew M. McCormack of the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacie B. Harris of the Middle District of Florida.
