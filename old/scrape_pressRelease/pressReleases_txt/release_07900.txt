On various dates, Jimmy Kha met with others who traveled to Long Beach, Calif., from various locations to provide compensation for previous rhinoceros horn purchases and shipments and to provide money to fund future purchases and shipments of rhinoceros horn. Jimmy and Felix Kha received, bought, sold and facilitated the transportation of black rhinoceros horn, prior to exportation, knowing that such rhinoceros horn was intended for exportation and that it was illegal under U.S. law to do so. Jimmy Kha paid, on average, between $5,000 to $7,000 per pound of rhinoceros horn. The black and white rhinoceros horn acquired by the defendants has a fair market value between, at a minimum, $1 million to $2.5 million. None   As a supplier for the Khas, Steffen bought and mailed dozens of rhino horns to the pair and made at least 10 trips to California to pick up payment and collect money for additional purchases. On the last of these trips, Transportation and Security Administration officers, acting at the FWSs request, stopped Steffan and two travel companions at the airport in Long Beach before they boarded their homebound flight and retrieved $337,000 from their luggage.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone
