J. Keith McCray, previously a criminal investigator with the Macon County, Alabama, Sheriffs Office, was sentenced today by Judge Myron H. Thompson to serve 36 months in prison and two years of supervised release for assaulting a handcuffed man at the county jail, announced the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Alabama.On April 4, 2014, McCray pleaded guilty to one felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law. At the plea hearing, McCray admitted that he arrested a salesman who was selling alarm systems in McCrays neighborhood and transported him to the Macon County Jail. There, McCray struck the victim four times in the face and head while the victim was handcuffed and posed no threat.In attacking a defenseless innocent civilian, this officer chose to abuse his power rather than uphold his oath to protect the public, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Molly Moran for the Civil Rights Division.  The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line to engage in acts of criminal misconduct. While we look to law enforcement to maintain the safety and security of our citizens, their position of authority does not give them the right to act outside the bounds of the law, said U.S. Attorney George L. Beck, Jr. for the Middle District of Alabama. Most members of law enforcement serve honorably and professionally. McCray breached his pledge to protect and serve and he must be held responsible for his actions. Failure to do so would discredit the noble service of every other officer, and weaken the publics trust in those who are sworn to protect them. This case was investigated by the FBI and the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. The case was being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jerusha T. Adams and Jonathan Ross of the Middle District of Alabama and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Civil Rights Division.
