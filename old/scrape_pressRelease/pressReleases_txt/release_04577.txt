The United States has asked a federal court in Las Vegas to bar a Las Vegas man from preparing federal tax returns that contain or involve foreign earned income, and from promoting to others the exclusion of foreign earned income.The complaint, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, alleges that Harvey L. Cage, who does business as CSN Tax Services, inappropriately attempts to exclude foreign earned income from the calculation of his customers federal tax liabilities. According to the complaint, from 2009 through 2012, Cage personally prepared more than 3,200 tax returns, of which approximately 25 percent contained the foreign earned income exclusion.NoneAccording to the complaint, Cages activities have resulted in an estimated average tax loss of more than $12,000 per examined return. The United States alleges that the additional taxes due from Cages customers, excluding interest and penalties, is greater than $3.7 million and continues to grow as additional examinations are completed. After many of his customers had been audited, Cage failed to provide his Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) on the tax returns he prepared, in violation of federal law, according to the suit.None
