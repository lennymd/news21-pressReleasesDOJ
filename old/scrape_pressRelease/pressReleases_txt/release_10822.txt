  WASHINGTON  The United States has sued Gwenn Wycoff and Frank Ozak of Los Angeles seeking to bar them from promoting the formation and operation of "common-law" trusts for the purpose of tax avoidance, the Justice Department announced today.None  A major goal in creation of such trusts, the complaint asserts, is to make it appear as if the taxpayers themselves have little to no income, and thereby evade the payment of federal income taxes. Indeed, as the complaint alleges, Wycoff and Ozak have their customers sign an "Oath of Privacy" (in which they agree to not disclose trust business or face penalties of up to $100,000) as a means of preventing customers from disclosing to the governmentfacts revealing the illegality of the trusts.  The governments lawsuit contends that the trusts created with the assistance of Wycoff and Ozak (including one they created for themselves) either to be sham entities or to have made false and fraudulent claims in the trust income tax returns. Wycoff and Ozaks misconduct, the complaint alleges, has caused great harm; the total amount of tax deficiencies assessed by the government to date in just four cases involving Wycoff and Ozak-created trusts is over $1.1 million.None
