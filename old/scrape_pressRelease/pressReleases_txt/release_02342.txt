Lynch. For far too long, Mississippi has failed people with mental illness, violating their civil rights by confining them in isolating institutions. Our lawsuit seeks to end these injustices, and it sends a clear signal that we will continue to fight for the full rights and liberties of Americans with mental illnessWhen individuals with mental illness get the services they need and the care they deserve, they can live and work in their own communities, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Mississippi violates the ADA by denying residents with disabilities the services the law requires and the support they deserve, forcing them to cycle in and out of state hospitals, emergency rooms and jails. The Justice Departments lawsuit demonstrates our firm commitment to vindicate the rights of people with mental illness.In Mississippi, adults with mental illness receive inadequate mental health care  care that is too often in segregated, institutional placements, said U.S. Attorney Gregory Davis of the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi has not developed the necessary supports in the community to prevent unnecessary institutionalization as required by the ADA.The complaint alleges that gaps and weaknesses in the states mental health system too often subject adults with mental illness to needless trauma, especially during a crisis. According to the complaint, adults with mental illness who experience a crisis in Mississippi often spend days in local emergency rooms and jail holding facilities that are ill-equipped to address their needs, before ultimately being transported to the states psychiatric hospitals. This costly and traumatic process could be avoided if adults with mental illness received proven and effective services in the community to prevent and deescalate crises, enable them to maintain safe housing and assist them in finding and holding employment.NoneNoneNone
