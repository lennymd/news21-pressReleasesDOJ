None   NoneNone    Dear Mr. Speaker: None None     These new lawsuits, by contrast, will require the Department to take an affirmative position on the level of scrutiny that should be applied to DOMA Section 3 in a circuit without binding precedent on the issue.  As described more fully below, the President and I have concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny and that, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under state law, Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional.    None None None None None None None None None     In other words, under heightened scrutiny, the United States cannot defend Section 3 by advancing hypothetical rationales, independent of the legislative record, as it has done in circuits where precedent mandates application of rational basis review.   Instead, the United States can defend Section 3 only by invoking Congress actual justifications for the law. None None None     Notwithstanding this determination, the President has informed me that Section 3 will continue to be enforced by the Executive Branch.  To that end, the President has instructed     Executive agencies to continue to comply with Section 3 of DOMA, consistent with the Executives obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, unless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judicial branch renders a definitive verdict against the laws constitutionality.  This course of action respects the actions of the prior Congress that enacted DOMA, and it recognizes the judiciary as the final arbiter of the constitutional claims raised.   NoneNone     Furthermore, pursuant to the Presidents instructions, and upon further notification to Congress, I will instruct Department attorneys to advise courts in other pending DOMA litigation of the President's and my conclusions that a heightened standard should apply, that Section 3 is unconstitutional under that standard and that the Department will cease defense of Section 3. None       Sincerely yours,None    ______________________________________ None None None None NoneNoneNone None
