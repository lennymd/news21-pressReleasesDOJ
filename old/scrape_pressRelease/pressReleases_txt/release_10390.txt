  WASHINGTON - Fifteen individuals have been extradited over the past week from Mexico to the United States to stand trial, to be sentenced or to serve sentences, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.   Twelve of the 15 defendants are charged with federal narcotics-related offenses and the remaining three are accused of violent crimes in state-prosecuted cases.   Extraditions are an important tool we have to ensure that criminals are brought to justice in this country, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. Over the past decade, the Department of Justice has established stronger partnerships with Mexico in many areas of law enforcement, including extraditions to and from each country.   With these extraditions of individuals who committed or stand charged with violent and dangerous crimes, we look forward to seeing those partnerships continue to strengthen.   Three defendants charged in the Northern District of Illinois are arriving today in Chicago.   Nine of the defendants departed Mexico and arrived in Houston Saturday morning, while the remaining three arrived in the United States over the course of the past week, beginning on Dec. 8, 2010.   The U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI will transport the defendants to the jurisdictions in which they are charged.   The extradited defendants are the following: NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone None NoneNoneNone None None None   Charges are merely allegations and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.   The Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs (OIA) worked with law enforcement colleagues in the United States and Mexico to affect the extraditions.   Individuals pending trial will be prosecuted by attorneys from the jurisdictions in which they are charged.
