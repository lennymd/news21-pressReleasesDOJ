A former chief financial officer for Bankrate Inc., a publicly traded financial services and marketing company headquartered in North Palm Beach, Florida, was charged in an indictment unsealed today for his alleged participation in a complex accounting and securities fraud scheme. None None The deceptive accounting practices that Edward DiMaria allegedly engaged in can cause real financial harm to investors, along with broader reputational harm to U.S. markets and our country, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. Safeguarding the integrity of our markets  while holding responsible those executives who refuse to follow the rule of law  are important priorities for the Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners.  This type of sophisticated financial fraud scheme can have a negative impact on the financial markets in the United States and around the world, said Inspector in Charge Faulkerson. Anyone who engages in such conduct should know they will not go undetected and be held accountable. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of investigating complex financial fraud schemes in order to protect investors as well as the integrity of the financial marketplace from fraudulent activities by trusted insiders who abuse their positions.
