    Troy A. Beam of Shippensburg, Pa., was sentenced today to 74 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Christopher C. Conner, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced. On May 4, 2011, a federal jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania convicted Beam of tax evasion, obstructing and impeding the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws, and willful failure to file federal income tax returns.    According to evidence introduced at trial, Beam, a former certified public accountant and state auditor in the Pennsylvania Auditor Generals Office, earned substantial sums of income from 1992 to the date of the indictment while operating a home construction business known as Sunbeam Builders, as well as owning and operating two real estate businesses known as Latrobe Leasing and Goldstar Property Management that purchased, rented and sold real estate. Despite earning substantial income from these businesses, as well as other activities, Beam failed to file any federal income tax returns since April 1996, when he filed his 1995 tax return reporting a loss. In April 1996, Beam also filed false amended federal income tax returns for 1992, 1993 and 1994, seeking tax refunds for taxes he previously had paid for those years.        The evidence at trial proved that from 1999 to 2007, Beam earned more than $10.3 million in gross income from his various home construction and rental property businesses. Beam obstructed the IRS in its attempt to calculate and collect his taxes by using numerous sham trusts and other entities, including North Star Investment Holdings Ltd. to hide his income and assets. He used North Star to set up a bank account in the Cayman Islands into which he deposited nearly $3 million of income derived from his construction business.      Convictions such as this send a loud and clear message that those who defy our nation's tax laws will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, said Kathryn M. Keneally, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Tax Division.     The evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Troy Beam is a consummate fraud and hypocrite who evaded his responsibilities as a citizen while participating in a charade to deceive the government, other citizens and himself for his own selfish ends, said Peter J. Smith, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.      The use of abusive trust schemes and sham entities intended to conceal income from the IRS isn't tax planning; its criminal activity, said Rick A. Raven, Acting Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. As the tax filing season comes to a close, its more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is paying the taxes they owe.    This case was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S.s Attorney Bruce Brandler and Trial Attorneys Jorge Almonte and Mark McDonald of the Tax Division.
