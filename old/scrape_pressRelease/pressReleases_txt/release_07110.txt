  A California woman pleaded guilty to illegally feeding killer whales in the wild this Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, Calif., the Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California announced.  Nancy Black of Monterey, Calif. pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), specifically the MMPAs feeding prohibition. The MMPA regulations make it a crime to feed marine mammals in the wild. The prohibition applies to commercial and recreational boaters, and applies to all species of marine mammals.  Killer whales (orcas) prey on gray whales in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. On the occasions when orcas manage to kill a gray whale, the pod of orcas does not always eat all of the gray whale at once. Often, portions of the carcass, including strips and chunks of blubber (some over six feet in length and weighing over a hundred pounds), remain floating or semi-submerged after a kill. Orcas and sea birds feed on these chunks of blubber while they are still available in the area.None  Black voluntarily agreed to provide the videotape, but prior to doing so she edited the video footage to remove several minutes that included footage of the humpback whale between two vessels that belonged to Blacks whale watching business, among other footage, and sounds. Black did not tell the officer that she had edited the tape. In filed court papers, Black admitted that by not disclosing the editing of the video, she could have impeded or influenced NOAA's investigation into the humpback whale incident.  Sentencing in the case is set for Aug. 6, 2013.NonePlea Agreement
