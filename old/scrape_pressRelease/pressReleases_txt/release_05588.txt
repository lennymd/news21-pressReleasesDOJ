The United States filed a complaint today to bar Victor M. Crown, individually and through his businesses Crown and Franklin Accounting and Refunds, Crown-Franklin Accounting Inc., Accurate Accounting PV, and Lourdes Theodossis Estate, from promoting two alleged tax fraud schemes and from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced.NoneAccording to the complaint, Crown prepares federal income tax returns and other documents that claim false amounts of income tax withheld from his customers earnings. The government contends that Crown asserts that his customers can claim credit for false amounts of tax withheld based on his contention that the city of Chicago incorrectly calculated the income taxes it withheld from its employees wages. According to the complaint, Crowns claims lack merit because an employee is not entitled to claim an income tax withholding credit for more than the amount of income taxes actually withheld from their wages.NoneNoneRelated Materials:None
