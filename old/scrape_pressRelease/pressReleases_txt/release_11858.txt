  Former Alaska State Representative Beverly Masek was sentenced today to six months in prison by U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline in Anchorage, Alaska. Masek, 45, was also ordered to serve three years of supervised release.  Masek pleaded guilty on March 12, 2009, to conspiring with former Alaska businessmen Bill J. Allen and Richard L. Smith to commit bribery. Allen was the chief executive officer of VECO Corporation (VECO), a now-defunct multinational oil field services company, and Smith was a VECO vice president. Both pleaded guilty to multiple federal corruption charges in May 2007 and are awaiting sentencing.  "Citizens must have faith that the officials they elect to represent their best interests will do so without the stain of bribery and corruption," said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. "Through the diligent work of our public corruption prosecutors, we will continue to hold accountable those government officials who violate the public trust."  According to her plea agreement, in the spring of 2003, Masek received multiple cash payments from Allen and one of his relatives. During the same time, Masek knew that the company for which Allen and Smith worked had matters pending before the Alaska state legislature, and she knew that these matters were important to Allens business interests. Specifically, Masek admitted in her plea agreement that she agreed on May 7, 2003, to withdraw a piece of legislation at the request of Allen, one day before she accepted a cash payment of approximately $2,000 from Allen. Masek admitted she knew that Allen gave her the money in part because of her agreement to withdraw the piece of legislation.  The sentencing was handled by Trial Attorneys M. Kendall Day and Marc Levin of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section. The case was investigated by the FBI.
