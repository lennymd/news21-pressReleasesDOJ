Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced today a new guidance from the Justice Department designed to help law enforcement agencies prevent gender bias in their response to sexual assault and domestic violence, highlighting the need for clear policies, robust training and responsive accountability systems.Gender bias, whether explicit or implicit, can severely undermine law enforcements ability to protect survivors of sexual and domestic violence and hold offenders accountable, said Attorney General Lynch. This guidance  developed in collaboration with law enforcement leaders and advocates from across the country  is designed to help state, local, and tribal authorities more fairly and effectively address allegations of domestic violence and sexual assault. In the days and months ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work with our law enforcement partners nationwide to ensure that they have the tools and resources they need to prevent, investigate, and prosecute these horrendous crimes.Todays guidance  which reflects input from a wide array of stakeholders, including police leaders, victim advocates and civil rights advocates  aims to enhance the Justice Departments partnership with law enforcement officers who work tirelessly to protect their communities, advance bias-free policing and uphold the civil rights of the people they serve. The Justice Departments Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), the Civil Rights Division and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) collaborated to produce the guidance.The guidance serves two key purposes. First, it aims to examine how gender bias can undermine the response of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to sexual assault and domestic violence. Second, it provides a set of basic principles that  if integrated into LEAs policies, trainings and practices  will help ensure that gender bias, either intentionally or unintentionally, does not undermine efforts to keep victims safe and hold offenders accountable.The guidance, through a series of detailed case examples, advises law enforcement agencies to incorporate the following principles into clear policies, comprehensive training and effective supervision protocols:A form of discrimination, gender bias may result in LEAs providing less protection to certain victims on the basis of gender, failing to respond to crimes that disproportionately harm a particular gender or offering less robust services due to a reliance on gender stereotypes.Gender bias can manifest in police officers misclassifying or underreporting sexual assault and domestic violence cases; inappropriately jumping to conclusions and labeling sexual assault cases unfounded; failing to test sexual assault kits; interrogating rather than interviewing victims and witnesses; treating domestic violence as a family matter rather than a crime; failing to enforce protection orders; or failing to treat same-sex domestic violence as a crime. These failures may ultimately compromise law enforcements ability to ascertain the facts, determine whether the incident constitutes a crime and develop a case that holds the perpetrator accountable. The Department of Justice has included additional resources in an appendix to the guidance to further assist LEAs in improving their response to sexual assault and domestic violence.
