  Xavier Jimnez-Bencev, aka Xavi, 28, faces life in prison following his conviction of murdering Delia Snchez-Snchez, a federal witness on a drug trafficking case, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodrguez-Vlez.  On April 30, 2013, Jimnez-Bencev was convicted of four counts of murder of a federal witness, possession of a firearm, attempted kidnapping and possession of a machine gun. According to court records and evidence at trial, on June 21, 2010, Jimnez-Bencev murdered a woman he believed was about to report his drug distribution activities to federal agents. He conspired with others to lure the woman, Delia Snchez-Snchez, to a public location, and then he fatally shot her.  The counts of conviction on capital murder charges necessitated a separate penalty phase of the trial, which began on May 1, 2013. Today, the jury announced it was unable to reach a unanimous sentencing verdict. As a result, a sentence of life in prison will be imposed on Aug. 6, 2013. The federal system does not have parole.  The case was investigated by the FBI and the Puerto Rico Police Department, and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jos Cap-Iriarte, Ilianys Rivera-Miranda and Luke V. Cass and Trial Attorney James Dennis Peterson of the Capital Case Unit of the Justice Departments Criminal Division.
