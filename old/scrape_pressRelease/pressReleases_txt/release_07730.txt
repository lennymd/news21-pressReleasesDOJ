      A Newport News, Va., federal jury has found Jeffrey Charles guilty for conspiring with his daughter and son-in-law to defraud the United States, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. Charles was found guilty of one count of conspiracy, three counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns and one count of filing a false tax return.      According to the evidence presented at trial, Charles conspired with his daughter and son-in-law to impair and impede the IRS in ascertaining, computing, assessing and collecting federal income taxes. The evidence also proved that Charles aided and assisted in the preparation of three false tax returns in his daughters name for tax years 2000, 2001 and 2005, and attached false documents to each tax return.  The evidence at trial also established that Charles filed a false tax return in his own name for tax year 2006 in which he allegedly falsely reported earning $0.00 income.       Senior Judge Henry Coke Morgan, Jr. scheduled sentencing for Feb. 25, 2012 in Norfolk, Va.      The case was investigated by IRS Criminal Investigation and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Samuels and Trial Attorney Justin K. Gelfand of the Justice Departments Tax Division.
