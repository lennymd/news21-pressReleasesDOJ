The United States has sued an Oregon City, Oregon woman to bar her from promoting an alleged tax fraud scheme, the Justice Department announced today. The governments complaint alleges that Priscilla E. Schrock promotes the formation and use of Religious Non-Profit Corporations (RNPCs), which Schrock falsely informs her customers are exempt from tax laws. According to the complaint, Schrock claims that by assigning income to the RNPC, the customer can avoid paying federal income tax on their income. Schrock also tells her customers that transferring assets to an RNPC protects the assets from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collection action, the complaint alleges. The suit asks the court to bar Schrock from promoting and selling the scheme and to order her to provide a list of her customers names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses to the Justice Department.According to the complaint, Schrock promotes the scheme through an Oregon City based entity called South Beach Missions. The complaint also alleges that the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon previously enjoined a similar scheme that John D. Fitzgerald promoted. According to the complaint, Fitzgerald and Schrock are friends and some of Fitzgeralds former customers are now Schrocks customers.NoneNone
