None  Libman was also sentenced by U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga to lifetime supervised release, following his prison term. He was indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida on April 28, 2009, for child pornography offenses. He pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography on Sept. 8, 2009. As part of his plea agreement, Libman admitted he received images that depict prepubescent children and children engaged in sadistic or masochistic conduct.  Libman was first identified by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the FBI during an investigation of Webe Web Corp., a Florida-based company. According to court documents, during the execution of a search warrant at Libman's residence in Fort Lauderdale, USPIS and FBI seized large volumes of computer media.  Libman, Marc Evan Greenberg and Webe Web Corp. were also indicted in November 2006 in a separate case in the Northern District of Alabama for conspiracy to produce images of child pornography and transportation of images of child pornography. That case is still pending.  An indictment is merely an allegation. Defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant Deputy Chief Alexandra R. Gelber and Trial Attorney Elizabeth M. Yusi of the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Marie Villafaa of the Southern District of Florida. The case was investigated by USPIS, the FBI and the CEOS High Technology Investigative Unit.
