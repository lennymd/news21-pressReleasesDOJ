        The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in McAllen, Texas, permanently barred Maria I. Cantu from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  Cantu, a tax preparer in McAllen, agreed to the civil injunction order.           The order also requires Cantu to turn over to the United States a list of all persons for whom she prepared federal tax returns or claims for a refund for tax years 2010 through 2012, and to notify these customers of the permanent injunction against her.   The order authorizes the United States to monitor Cantus compliance with the terms of the order.None None
