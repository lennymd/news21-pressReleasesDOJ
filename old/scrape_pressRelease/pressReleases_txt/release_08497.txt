      A federal grand jury in Montgomery, Ala., returned an indictment on March 28, 2012, charging Wanda Davis with filing false federal income tax returns, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.  The indictment was unsealed today following Daviss initial appearance.         Davis is charged with 23 counts of filing false tax returns for clients.  According to the indictment, from 2007 to 2011, Davis prepared 23 false tax returns while working at Davis Fast Tax and later her own business, Davis Tax Service.  The tax returns claimed false deductions and business, resulting in inflated tax refunds.       An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, Davis faces a maximum of three years in federal prison for each of the 23 false tax return counts.  Davis is also subject to fines if convicted.       This case was investigated by IRS  Criminal Investigation special agents.  U.S. Department of Justice Tax Division Trial Attorneys Michael Boteler and Chad Spraker are prosecuting the case with the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Middle District of Alabama.
