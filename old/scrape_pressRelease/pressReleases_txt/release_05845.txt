A federal judge in California has permanently barred Michael I. Turner, of San Diego, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.In the complaint, filed in August 2013, the government alleged that Turner has prepared returns since at least 2004 but failed to sign or affix a Preparer Tax Identification Number to many of the returns that he has prepared. The complaint also alleged that Turner entered bogus deductions on his customers returns, primarily on the Schedule A, Itemized Deductions, in order to claim larger refunds for those customers. Further, the government alleged that when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited Turners customers, he provided the customers with false documents in an attempt to assist them in falsely substantiating charitable contributions and employee expenses that they did not incur. Turner pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in 2013.In addition to barring Turner from preparing returns, the courts civil injunction order bars Turner from serving as a representative on behalf of any person or entity before the IRS, and from owning, managing, controlling, working for or volunteering for a tax return preparation business. In consenting to the injunction, Turner did not admit to the governments allegations.NoneRelated Materials:None
