      WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice announced today that Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. and Legacy Bancorp Inc. have agreed to sell four branch offices in Berkshire County, Mass., with approximately $158 million in deposits, to resolve antitrust concerns about the companies pending merger. The department said that, with the divestitures, the merger would not have an adverse effect on competition in local markets for retail banking or small business banking services. The combined entity will be worth almost $4 billion in assets and have a total of 69 branches in three states.       Under the agreement with the Justice Departments Antitrust Division, the companies will divest four Legacy branches located in North Adams, Pittsfield, Lee and Great Barrington, Mass. The divestitures will include the commercial loans associated with the divested branches.        With the divestiture, consumers and small businesses in Berkshire County will continue to enjoy the benefits of competition in banking services, said Christine Varney, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division.        The proposed merger is subject to the final approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). The department said that it will advise the OTS that it will not challenge the merger provided that the parties divest the branch offices specified in the agreement and associated loans and deposits; and provided that the parties commit to the OTS that they will comply with the agreement with the department.
