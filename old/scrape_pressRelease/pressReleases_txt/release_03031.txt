NoneIt has been only a year-and-a-half since we launched the first Violence Reduction Network, said Deputy Attorney General Yates. In just that short period of time, the partnerships we have built through VRN have helped to reduce crime rates. These results could only have happened through the kind of creative collaboration promoted through the VRN.Todays announcement was made before an audience of U.S. Attorneys, police chiefs, local leaders from the new and existing VRN sites and department officials. Through VRN, the Justice Department enlists tactical and operational expertise available from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the United States Marshals Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Executive Office of the United States Attorneys, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and the Office on Violence Against Women.NoneIn 2014, VRN was launched in Camden, Chicago, Detroit, Wilmington, and Oakland and Richmond, California. In September 2015, VRN was expanded to Compton, California; Flint, Michigan; Little Rock and West Memphis, Arkansas; and Newark, New Jersey.VRNs core components include customized training and technical assistance; a strategic site liaison to guide the coordination of Justice Department resources; tools to enhance information sharing, including peer-to-peer exchanges; community practice collaboration among existing sites and an annual summit in September.
