  WASHINGTON - A federal court has permanently barred Donald Morris of Bloomfield, Conn., from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. Morris consented to the permanent injunction order, which was entered by U.S. District Court Judge Jane C. Hall in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.  According to the government complaint, Morris prepared over 1,000 federal income tax returns from 2003 through 2008. The complaint alleges that returns prepared by Morris claimed deductions for fictitious or inflated un-reimbursed employee expenses, deductions for fictitious or inflated job search expenses, fictitious or inflated education credits and fictitious or inflated credits for child care expenses.None
