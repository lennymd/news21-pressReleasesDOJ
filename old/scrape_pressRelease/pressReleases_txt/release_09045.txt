      WASHINGTON  A Bloomington, Ind., man was sentenced today in the Southern District of Indiana to 315 years in prison for multiple charges relating to his production and trafficking of child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney   Joseph H. Hogsett of the Southern District of Indiana.         David R. Bostic, 25, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson.  In addition to Bostics prison term, Judge Magnus-Stinson also sentenced Bostic to lifetime supervised release.         Mr. Bostic committed heinous acts of sexual abuse against the most vulnerable in our society, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  He memorialized these unspeakable crimes by producing photographs of his abuse and distributing them to an international network of child predators.  No prison term can undo the pain and suffering Mr. Bostic has caused.  But todays sentence sends a strong message that child sexual exploitation will be punished severely.       This defendant is among the most dangerous offenders ever prosecuted by this office, said U.S. Attorney Hogsett. My heart goes out to the many victims in this case, but we can say today that thanks to the efforts of prosecutors and our law enforcement partners, this man will never again be able to prey on the most innocent among us.         This case is considered one of the most significant child pornography matters ever investigated by the FBI, said Deputy Assistant Director Michael S. Welch of the FBIs Cyber Division.  This case resulted in the identification and rescue of approximately two dozen children from inside and outside the United States.       Bostic pleaded guilty on June 6, 2011, to producing child pornography images of five children, all four years of age and younger, including one child who was only two months old.  Bostic distributed some of these images to several individuals around the world in exchange for other child pornography, some of which was material produced by those trading partners.       Bostic also pleaded guilty for his role in an international conspiracy to traffic in child pornography primarily involving images of minors under five years of age.   Bostic initially gained the trust of the principal administrator of that group by providing the child pornography images he produced.       This case was the result of the significant efforts of the FBI, with assistance from the Indiana State Police; the Kokomo, Ind., Police Department; and the Brownsburg, Ind., Police Department.       The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Brant Cook of the Southern District of Indiana and Trial Attorney Michael Grant of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Justice Departments Criminal Division.   None
