The Justice Department today announced it has signed a settlement agreement with West Liberty Foods L.L.C., an Iowa-based meat processing business that operates a plant in Bolingbrook, Illinois, to resolve the Departments investigation into whether the company discriminated against work-authorized immigrants when verifying their employment authorization, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).The Departments investigation revealed that West Liberty Foods routinely asked non-U.S. citizens hired at its Bolingbrook location to present specific documents, such as permanent resident cards or Employment Authorization Documents, to establish their work authority but did not make similar requests of U.S. citizens. The anti-discrimination provision of the INA prohibits employers from subjecting employees to more or different documentary demands based on employees citizenship, immigration status, or national origin.Under the settlement, West Liberty Foods will pay a civil penalty of $52,100 to the United States, ensure that its human resources staff participate in department-provided training, post notices informing workers about their rights under the INAs anti-discrimination provision, and be subject to departmental monitoring for two years.When verifying an employees work authorization, employers must ensure that they do not impose unlawful barriers based on citizenship status, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division. We commend West Liberty Foods for its cooperation with the Departments investigation, and look forward to working with the company to implement this agreement.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin, or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral for a fee, should contact IERs worker hotline for assistance.
