This brings the number of convictions in the second quarter to 754. In all, the Department of Justice has reported 1,260 convictions of members of transnational criminal organizations and their subsidiaries since Jan. 1, 2017.At a time when homicide rates are up in 27 of our 35 biggest cities and violent crime is rising, the Trump administration has made it a top priority to deter and reduce violent crime through enforcing our laws, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. One of the gravest threats we face is from transnational criminal organizations, and the Department of Justice is taking on this threat, convicting more than 1,260 gang members already this year. These convictions send a clear message to gang members and would-be criminals through this country: we will find you and bring you to justice.The accompanying report, provided in accordance with Section 3 (g) of the Executive Order, provides information pertaining to the number of convictions in investigations involving transnational criminal organizations as reported by the Department of Justice, for the period beginning April 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2017.
