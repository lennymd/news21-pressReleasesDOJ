NoneNoneIn a 23-year career with the Chicago Police Department, Burge rose through the ranks to commander before being fired in 1993 over allegations of abuse. Special prosecutors were appointed in 2002 to investigate claims of abuse by Burge and others. A four-year investigation concluded that the abuse was outside the statute of limitations. It was a pending civil suit that was the basis for the federal charges in this case.Burge abused his power and betrayed the public trust by abusing suspects in his custody, and then by lying under oath to cover up what he and other officers had done, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The department will aggressively prosecute any officer who violates the Constitution. Today, we put to rest the decades of denials that torture of suspects in police custody occurred, said Patrick J. Fitzgerald, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. This sentence delivers a measure of justice, which Burge obstructed for so long.The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Weisman and April Perry from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl from the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
