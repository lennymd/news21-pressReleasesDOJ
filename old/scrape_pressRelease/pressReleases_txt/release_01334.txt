None Compliance with contract requirements is expected by all who contract with the U.S. government, but is especially critical in connection with the construction of a nuclear facility, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Departments Civil Division.  None Our complaint alleges that after actively touting its experience with nuclear construction and quality assurance work, and then being hired to perform such work in connection with an important project, E&P chose to forego the agreed to quality assurance work, and then compounded this failure by falsely certifying to the Government that it had performed the quality assurance work, said U.S. Attorney John A. Horn for the Northern District of Georgia. This settlement recovers substantial losses caused by E&Ps decision to cavalierly place its own profits above its commitment to adhere to important nuclear safety and quality control requirements. None None None The claims asserted against E&P are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
