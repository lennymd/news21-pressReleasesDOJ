WASHINGTON  Joshua Wall, 20, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Baltimore for his involvement in hanging a dead raccoon from a noose on the porch of an African-American family.Wall pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to deprive a person of civil rights, and admitted that in April 2010, he and four co-conspirators agreed on a plan to hang a dead raccoon from a noose on the porch of an African-American family to frighten the family and to interfere with their housing rights. Wall claimed that two of his co-conspirators drove around until they found a dead raccoon and made the noose to put around the raccoons neck.
