The United States announced today the filing of a consent order that resolves allegations that Fort Norfolk Retirement Community Inc. (Fort Norfolk) violated the Fair Housing Act by instituting policies that discriminated against residents with disabilities at Harbors Edge, a continuing care retirement community in Norfolk, Virginia.The consent order, which still needs to be approved by the court, was filed yesterday, along with a complaint, in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges that beginning in May 2011, Fort Norfolk instituted a series of policies that prohibited, and then limited, residents in the assisted living, nursing and memory support units at Harbors Edge from dining in dining rooms or attending community events with independent living residents. The complaint also alleges that when residents and family members complained about these policies, Fort Norfolk retaliated against them. In addition, the complaint alleges that Fort Norfolk had polices that discriminated against residents who used motorized wheelchairs by requiring those residents to pay a non-refundable fee, obtain liability insurance and obtain Fort Norfolks permission.Under the consent order, Fort Norfolk will pay $350,000 into a settlement fund to compensate residents and family members who were harmed by these policies. Fort Norfolk will also pay a $40,000 civil penalty to the United States. In addition, Fort Norfolk will appoint a Fair Housing Act compliance officer and will implement a new dining and events policy, a new reasonable accommodation policy and a new motorized wheelchair policy.This consent order will ensure that all residents with disabilities at Harbors Edge are treated equally and that spouses and friends will be able to eat and socialize together, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division. We are very pleased with Fort Norfolks willingness to work with us to achieve this important resolution.NoneNone
