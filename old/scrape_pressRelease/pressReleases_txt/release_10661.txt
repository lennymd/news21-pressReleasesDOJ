  HOUSTON  The Department of Justice announced today $298 million in grants to fund the hiring and retaining of 1,388 state, local and tribal law enforcement officers by 379 police and sheriffs departments in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The funding will be administered by the departments Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and is being awarded under the COPS Hiring Program.  The grants provide 100 percent of the approved salary and benefits for entry level officer positions over a three year period. Police departments receiving the grants will then be required to retain the grant-funded positions for a fourth year. The funding will provide much needed support to state and local government budgets, and will help the nations law enforcement agencies add and retain the manpower needed to fight crime more effectively through community policing.  "We know that the men and women who serve on our nations police forces not only respond to crime, but also are critical to reducing it and preventing it," said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli. "The departments COPS program is based on a simple recognition  there is almost nothing more effective in keeping the public safe than cops on the beat who have the equipment and resources they need."  "American law enforcement is consistently seeking opportunities to better serve the public and fight crime, and todays grants to hire community policing officers supports these efforts," said COPS Director Bernard K. Melekian. None
