None According to documents and information presented to the court, Doris Kelley, 65, operated a tax return preparation business from her home in Gulfport. Kelley instructed several of her clients, who owed income taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), to write payment checks directly to her rather than to the IRS. Kelley kept these funds for herself and used most of the money to gamble at local casinos. Typically, Kelley provided copies of accurate returns to her clients, but then did not file any return with the IRS. In some cases, she also filed false returns in her clients names without their knowledge. Kelley earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from her scheme and caused a tax loss of more than $500,000.
