NoneI am deeply saddened by the shooting in Harford County, Maryland, that took the lives of two long-serving sheriffs deputies. This was an appalling and senseless crime, carried out against two dedicated guardians of the public. Losses like these are a tragic reminder of the dangers our public safety officers face every day  and the courage and commitment they routinely demonstrate in the fulfilment of their extraordinary charge. My thoughts and prayers  and those of my colleagues throughout the law enforcement community  are with the families and loved ones of our fallen friends.
