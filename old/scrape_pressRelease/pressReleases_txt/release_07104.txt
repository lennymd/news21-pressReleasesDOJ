None   A felony charge was filed today in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark, against Norman T. Remick, of Barnegat, N.J. According to the charge, from in or about the beginning of 2007 until approximately February 2009, Remick participated in a conspiracy to rig bids at auctions for the sale of municipal tax liens in New Jersey by agreeing to allocate among certain bidders which liens each would bid on. The department said that Remick proceeded to submit bids in accordance with the agreements and purchased tax liens at collusive and non-competitive interest rates.NoneNone   According to the court documents, Remick was involved in a conspiracy with others not to bid against one another at municipal tax lien auctions in New Jersey. Since the conspiracy permitted the conspirators to purchase tax liens with limited competition, each conspirator was able to obtain liens that earned a higher interest rate. Property owners were, therefore, made to pay higher interest on their tax debts than they would have paid had their liens been purchased through open and honest competition, the department said.None   Todays plea is the 12th guilty plea resulting from an ongoing investigation into bid rigging or fraud related to municipal tax lien auctions. Eight individuals  Isadore H. May, Richard J. Pisciotta Jr., William A. Collins, Robert W. Stein, David M. Farber, Robert E. Rothman, Stephen E. Hruby and David Butler  and three companies  DSBD LLC, Crusader Servicing Corp. and Mercer S.M.E. Inc.  have previously pleaded guilty as part of this investigation.None None
