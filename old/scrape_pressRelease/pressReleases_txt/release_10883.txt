Breuer for the Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Robert Cessar for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  Fred Woolum, 58, of Lexington, Va., pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Arthur A. Schwab to one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise. Daniel Cox, 54, of Houston, pleaded guilty Wednesday before Judge Schwab to one count of conspiring to distribute and receive child pornography.
