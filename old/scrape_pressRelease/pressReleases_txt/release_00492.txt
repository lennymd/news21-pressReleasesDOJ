A Louisiana tax return preparer was sentenced to seven years in prison today for filing fraudulent returns, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  According to documents filed with the court, Shawanda Nevers, aka Shawanda Hawkins, Shawanda Bryant, and Shawanda Johnson, 49, operated a series of businesses in the LaPlace area, including 3LJs Caf Services & Sports Bar LLC and 3LJs Industrial Service Solutions LLC. Between 2011 and 2016, Nevers filed fraudulent income tax returns that included fake business losses, deductions and tax credits and sought refunds to which her clients were not entitled. Despite a federal judge permanently enjoining her from preparing federal tax returns in 2014, Nevers continued to file fraudulent returns.   In addition to the term of prison imposed, U.S. District Court Judge Susie Morgan ordered Nevers to serve one year of supervised release and to pay restitution to the IRS for $6,934,764 in losses that she caused. She also was ordered to pay $128,900 to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust and $964 to the Social Security Administration. Nevers pleaded guilty to filing fraudulent tax returns in August.
