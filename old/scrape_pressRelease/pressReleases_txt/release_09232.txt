      NEW YORK  September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) Special Master Sheila L. Birnbaum today announced that the fund is officially open for claimants.  With todays opening, potential claimants can now register online, receive a checklist of documents and information that they will need to accompany their claim submission, and access newly updated Frequently Asked Questions. Special Master Birnbaum announced that the VCF will begin accepting claims through its website next month and that the funds staff will offer a series of seminars on how to submit claims.   NoneNone       Special Master Birnbaum noted in an email to potential claimants and interested parties that they are not required to submit claims on the first day that claim forms are available, and that pro bono counsel are volunteering to assist claimants.  Claimants who currently suffer from a covered condition have until Oct. 3, 2013, to file a claim, and others will have two years from the date on which they know or should have known of the condition for which they seek compensation, until the VCF stops accepting claims in 2016.         Birnbaum was appointed as special master by Attorney General Eric Holder on May 18, 2011, and has spent several months meeting with, and receiving feedback from, hundreds of New York-area residents, workers and first responders at town hall meetings held in New York and New Jersey.       The James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act reactivated the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund that operated from 2001-2004.   The act expands the pool of claimants to include first responders and other individuals in the community who experienced latent physical injuries associated with the attacks or with debris removal.
