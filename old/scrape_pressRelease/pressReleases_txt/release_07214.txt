NoneNoneNoneNone       On March 18, 2013, the state of Michigan enacted legislation that, among other reforms, prohibits health insurers, including BCBSM, from including or using MFNs in provider contracts. The MFN ban takes effect on Jan. 1, 2014. Since Feb. 1, 2013, the Michigan Insurance Commissioners order has prohibited all MFN clauses in any health insurers provider contracts.       The department and the state of Michigan alleged in their complaint that the MFN clauses in BCBSMs contracts with Michigan hospitals decreased competition among health plans. Some of BCBSMs MFN clauses required hospitals to charge BCBSMs competitors at least as much as the hospitals charged BCBSM. Other BCBSM MFN clauses required hospitals to charge competitors more than the hospitals charged BCBSM, often by a specified percentage. Moreover, BCBSM often agreed to raise the prices that it paid hospitals, in part to obtain MFN clauses.        At trial, the department and the Michigan Attorney General intended to demonstrate that BCBSMs MFN clauses reduced competition between BCBSM and its rival insurers and discouraged other health plans from entering or expanding in markets throughout Michigan, which increased prices self-funded employers and their employees paid to hospitals, and likely increased prices other Michigan residents and their employers paid to health plans and hospitals.None       Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan is a Michigan nonprofit healthcare corporation headquartered in Southfield, Mich.
