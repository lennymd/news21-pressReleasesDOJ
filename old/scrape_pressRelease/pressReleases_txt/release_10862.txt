  WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today filed a lawsuit against Dalton Township, Mich., alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, charges that the township discriminated against persons with disabilities based on its treatment of a group home for persons recovering from drug and alcohol addiction and its failure to grant a reasonable accommodation or modification to the owner of the group home.  This lawsuit arose as a result of a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by Joel Kruszynski Sr., who, through Cedar Creek Investments Inc., and Serenity Shores Apartments LLC, owns and operates a group home known as "Serenity Shores."None  "The Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act seek to ensure that individuals with disabilities can live in communities of their choice without facing discrimination," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. "We will continue our vigorous enforcement efforts to make certain that persons with disabilities are granted their rights under federal law."   "Under the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, persons with disabilities have the right to reside in communities and housing of their choice," said John Trasvia, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing & Equal Opportunity. "HUD will take legal actions to ensure that they can live in the most integrated setting."None  The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegations must still be proven in federal court.
