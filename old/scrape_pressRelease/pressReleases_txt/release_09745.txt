      WASHINGTON  Wesley William Brandt, 46, of Davenport, Fla., pleaded guilty today to three counts of production of child pornography, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Robert E. ONeill and Susan McCormick, Special Agent-in-Charge for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).       Brandt pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas G. Wilson in the Middle District of Florida.  According to court documents and proceedings, in February 2008, Brandt, posing as a 17-year-old boy, began communicating online with a 13-year-old girl from Colorado.  During these communications and through the use of other online personas, Brandt threatened and coerced the Colorado victim to produce sexually explicit photographs of herself and her 6-year-old sister.  Specifically, Brandt threatened to create a public website and post sexually explicit images of the victim if she did not send him additional sexually explicit images of herself.  Brandt was also introduced to the 13-year-old female cousin of the Colorado victim and similarly threatened and coerced her to produce sexually explicit photographs of herself.  A subsequent search of Brandts home yielded computers and computer storage devices containing multiple images of child pornography.       For each count, Brandt faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, as well as the possibility of lifetime supervised release.  Brandt also faces a fine of $250,000.       This case was investigated by   ICEs HSI  .  This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Andrew M. McCormack of the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacie B. Harris of the Middle District of Florida.
