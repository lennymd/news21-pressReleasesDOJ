WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice today announced the opening of their comprehensive grant solicitation period for funding to support public safety, victim services and crime prevention improvements for American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments. The departments Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS) will be posted at 9:00 p.m. EST today at www.justice.gov/tribal/open-sol.html.Through the Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation we have made it easier for tribes to tap much-needed federal funding for critical needs, such as violence against women, said Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West. We have made excellent progress in restoring a healthy government-to-government relationship with tribal nations, but we are far from finished with our work.CTAS is administered by the Justice Departments Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). The funding can be used to enhance law enforcement; bolster adult and juvenile justice systems; prevent and control juvenile delinquency; serve sexual assault, domestic violence and elder victims; and support other efforts to combat crime.
