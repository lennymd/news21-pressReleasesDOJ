  WASHINGTON    Gregory Alan Roberts, a resident of Fairfax County and Loudoun County, Va., pleaded guilty to failing to timely file income tax returns for the years 2003 and 2004, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.  At his plea hearing, Roberts admitted that he has not filed an individual income tax return with the IRS since at least 1998, despite the fact that he was required to do so by law. Roberts has worked as a real estate agent in Vienna, Va., since at least November 1994.  According to court documents, Roberts earned $146,344 in 2003 and owed $37,361 in taxes. He earned $128,007 in 2005 and owed $29,249 in taxes. Additionally, between 1998 and 2006, Roberts received between $42,388 and $146,344 in gross income each year and failed to pay the IRS at least $161,595 in taxes.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Ivan D. Davis of the Eastern District of Virginia released Roberts pending sentencing, which is scheduled for Aug. 31, 2010. Roberts faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a fine of $50,000. He has agreed to pay all taxes, interest and penalties for the years 1998 through 2006.  Acting Assistant Attorney General John A. DiCicco and Neil H. MacBride, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, commended the investigative efforts of the IRS agents involved in this case, as well as Tax Division Trial Attorneys Caryn D. Finley and Justin K. Gelfand, who are prosecuting the case.
