Two Gulfport, Mississippi men were sentenced to prison today for charges related to preparing fraudulent tax returns, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Harold Brittain for the Southern District of Mississippi.  Allen Brice was sentenced to serve 63 months in prison. He was convicted at trial of seven counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns. Jeremi Washington was sentenced to serve 46 months in prison. He previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States.  According to court documents and proceedings, Washington was a tax return preparer who owned and operated Flash Financial, and Brice was Washingtons sole employee. From 2009 through 2011, the two men filed fraudulent tax returns for multiple clients with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that included bogus education expenses and retirement contributions, which they never discussed with their clients. As a result, the clients received refunds they were not entitled to.  In addition to the terms of prison imposed, Brice and Washington were ordered to serve one and three years of supervised release. Brice was ordered to pay restitution to the IRS in the amount of $1,919,820.20 and Washington was ordered to pay $1,954,352.  Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Brittain commended special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher Wansley and Jay Golden and Trial Attorney Nathan Brooks of the Tax Division, who prosecuted the case.
