  "Moving past old disputes and ensuring cooperation between all levels of our Departments has been one of our top priorities since taking office.Today's agreement reflects our commitment to working together to protect the American people from violence and criminal activity along our borders.  Ultimately, this agreement allows us to utilize the full range of the federal governments capabilities to disrupt and dismantle drug cartels and other criminal organizations that seek to infiltrate our borders.   Giving ICE agents the authority to investigate drug trafficking cases, enhancing information sharing capabilities between ICE and the DEA, and ensuring full participation in intelligence centers will strengthen our efforts to combat international narcotics smuggling, streamline operations and bring better intelligence to our front line personnel."
