The Department of Justice today announced additional priority consideration criteria for FY 2017 Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) grants. Jurisdictions for FY 2017 were notified that their applications would receive additional points in the application scoring process if their agencies cooperate with federal law enforcement to address illegal immigration, ensuring that federal immigration authorities have the full ability to enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe. Cities and states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our communities, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. This cooperation is supported by the vast majority of the American people, and jurisdictions with these policies in place should be acknowledged for their commitment to ending violent crime, including violent crime stemming from illegal immigration. Today, the Justice Department announced it will recognize jurisdictions that commit to the rule of law by awarding additional points in the application scoring process for COPS Office grants. My hope is that this recognition will further incentivize every jurisdiction in America to collaborate with federal law enforcement and help us make this country safer.
