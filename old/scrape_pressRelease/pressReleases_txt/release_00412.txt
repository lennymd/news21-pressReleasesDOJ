In total, Herring filed approximately 225 fraudulent returns seeking approximately $845,979 in tax refunds.  In addition to the term of imprisonment, Herring was ordered to serve four years of supervised release and to pay $593,786 in restitution to the IRS. Herring pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in February 2016.
