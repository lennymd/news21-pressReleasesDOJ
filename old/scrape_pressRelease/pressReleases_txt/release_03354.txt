A jury found Frank Russell McCoy, 72, guilty of possession of child pornography after a two-day trial, announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota.For years, McCoy has written and distributed short stories describing extreme sexual abuse and other acts of violence perpetrated against very young children.

Schiltz of the District of Minnesota presided over the trial. McCoy is scheduled to be sentenced on April 5, 2016.ICE-HSI investigated this case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Katharine T. Buzicky of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney Jeffrey Zeeman of the Criminal Divisions Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) are prosecuting the case.None
