The United States has asked a federal court to shut down a tax-preparation office in Miami, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Olivia Greene and Walter Jefferson of Miami prepare returns through Angel Tax Service with falsely-claimed credits, including fuel tax credits, the earned-income tax credit, the work pay credit and educational credits.According to the complaint, in order to conceal her role in this scheme, Greene prepared returns using an alias, Olivia Mayo. The complaint alleges that after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rejected Greenes application for a preparer ID number, she hired other persons to obtain ID numbers in their names for Greene to use.NoneNoneNone
