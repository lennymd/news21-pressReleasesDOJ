NoneNone         As was shown at trial, federal agents uncovered substantial evidence of the conspiracy during the execution of search warrants at locations in Montgomery and near Birmingham, including over a hundred envelopes for debit cards that had been mailed to addresses on Harrisons postal route. Soon after, agents also conducted surveillance on Harrison and observed him failing to deliver Turbo Tax cards that were in the mail.          Harrison faces up to 10 years in prison for the conspiracy count, 20 years for each mail fraud count, five years for each mail embezzlement count, and a mandatory two-year sentence for the aggravated identity theft counts. In total, Harrison could be sentenced to up to 216 years in prison. Harrison also could be subject to fines, forfeiture, and mandatory restitution. NoneNone
