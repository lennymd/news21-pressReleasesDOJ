  WASHINGTON - A federal court has permanently barred Wayne Perry, a Macon, Ga., man, and his tax preparation firms, Premier Choice Inc. and Perry Tax Services, from preparing federal tax returns, the Justice Department announced today. Perry agreed to the injunction.  The governments complaint alleged that Perry fraudulently claimed fuel tax credits for customers who were not entitled to them. The fuel tax credit is available only to taxpayers who operate farm equipment or off-highway business vehicles. Perry allegedly claimed absurdly large credits by falsely reporting purchases of huge quantities of gasoline where, in most cases, the cost of the gasoline was greater than the customers annual income. Perry had prepared over 6,300 federal tax returns since 2004, according to the government.NoneNone
