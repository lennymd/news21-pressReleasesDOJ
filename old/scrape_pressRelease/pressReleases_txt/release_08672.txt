NoneNone       Habibion and Online Micro today admitted that they willfully conspired with a company operating in Dubai, UAE, and Tehran, Iran, to procure U.S.-origin computers from the United States and export those computers from the United States to Iran through Dubai without first obtaining licenses or authorizations from OFAC.         In or around May 2007, Online Micro purchased 1,000 computer units from Dell Inc. for approximately $500,000.  Later that year, Dell began receiving service calls concerning Dell computer units from individuals in Iran, and after conducting an internal investigation, suspended Online Micro from placing further orders with Dell.         Beginning around Nov. 9, 2009, and continuing through December 2010, Habibion and Online Micro conspired with Company X, a firm operating in Dubai and Tehran, to procure U.S.-origin computer-related goods and export those goods to Iran via the UAE.  During the scope of the conspiracy, defendants Online Micro and Habibion sold and exported from the United States to Company X numerous shipments of computer-related goods, worth a total of more than $4,904,962, with knowledge that the majority of those goods were destined for Iran.         Online Micro also caused Shippers Export Declarations to be filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection falsely identifying the ultimate destination of the goods as the UAE.  During the course of the investigation, Habibion and Motamedian told a government cooperator (Individual A) to lie to U.S. law enforcement officials about the transactions.  Specifically, the defendants told Individual A to lie about Iran being the true ultimate destination for the goods and counseled him to tell U.S. law enforcement agents that the computer-related goods remained in Dubai.       Motamedian and Habibion also acknowledged to Individual A that the sanctions are serious and were not a joke.   Yet Motamedian told Individual A to Say, I sold over there and have your guys make up invoices; and [d]efinitely delete your communication with [Company Xs agent in Iran] on Yahoo.   Similarly, Habibion stated to Individual A that he should tell U.S. law enforcement agents that the computer-related goods remained in Dubai: Well, you can say, I kept the goods there.   How does he know what happened?     This investigation was conducted by the ICEs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) field offices in San Diego and Orange County, Calif.       U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Commerces BIS Los Angeles Field Office also assisted in the investigation.       Senior Attorney Adrienne Frazier from the U.S. Department of Commerces BIS, and Assistant Director of Enforcement Michael Geffroy and Enforcement Officer Elizabeth Beam from OFAC handled the civil settlements for their agencies, respectively.
