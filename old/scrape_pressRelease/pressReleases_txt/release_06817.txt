  The Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that Shell Oil and affiliated partnerships (Shell) have agreed to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at a large refinery and chemical plant in Deer Park, Texas, by spending at least $115 million to control harmful air pollution from industrial flares and other processes, and by paying a $2.6 million civil penalty. Shell has agreed to spend $1 million on a state-of-the-art system to monitor benzene levels at the fenceline of the refinery and chemical plant near a residential neighborhood and school and to make the data available to the public through a website.None  This settlement will result in substantial reductions in toxic air pollution through state of the art technology and increased efficiencies at the Deer Park plant, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Robert G. Dreher of the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division. This agreement will bring Shell Oils refinery and chemical plant in Deer Park into compliance with the nations Clean Air Act and result in cleaner, healthier air for residents in the local communities for many years to come.  The innovative emission controls required by todays settlement will cut harmful air pollution in communities near Houston, said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator of EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. This case is part of EPAs nationwide enforcement effort to protect fenceline neighborhoods by significantly reducing toxic pollution from flares and making information about pollution quickly available to affected communities.  The settlement was filed at the same time the Justice Department filed a complaint on behalf of EPA alleging, among other things, that the company improperly operated its 12 steam-assisted flaring devices in such a way that excess VOCs, including benzene and other hazardous air pollutants, were emitted.  In addition to reducing pollution from flares, Shell will significantly modify its wastewater treatment plant; replace and repair tanks as necessary; inspect tanks biweekly with an infrared camera to better identify potential integrity problems that may lead to leaks; and implement enhanced monitoring and repair practices at the benzene production unit. When fully implemented, these specific projects are estimated to cost between $15 and $60 million.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone  Prior enforcement settlements related to industrial flaring:NoneNoneNoneNone
