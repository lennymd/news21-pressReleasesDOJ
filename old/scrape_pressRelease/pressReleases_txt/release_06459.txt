None None USERRA prohibits employers from discriminating against servicemembers with respect to employment opportunities based on their past, current or future uniformed service obligations. USERRA also requires employers to promptly reemploy service members following their return from military leave. Under the terms of the consent agreement, the Warren County Board of Education will, among other stipulations, reemploy Coffer under a two-year contract as a Lead Teacher/Site Supervisor at the salary he would have received had he remained continuously employed by the county, pay back-pay to Coffer in the amount of $10,000 and contribute lost retirement payments to Coffers retirement account in the amount of $13,702.63. USERRA affords military members who leave their civilian careers behind for significant periods of time to serve our country certain protections against unjust terminations, said Jocelyn Samuels, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. It is important that veterans have the opportunity to serve their country free from worry about termination without cause. I am pleased we were able to resolve this matter, said U.S. Attorney Thomas G. Walker. Improper job terminations over military service cannot be tolerated. The department initiated the lawsuit after Coffer filed a complaint with the Labor Departments Veterans Employment and Training Service, which investigated the matter and determined that the complaint had merit. This case was handled by the Employment Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina. None
