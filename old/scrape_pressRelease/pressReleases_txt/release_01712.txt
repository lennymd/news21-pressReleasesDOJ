The Justice Department today filed a lawsuit against KleinBank alleging that the bank engaged in unlawful redlining of majority-minority neighborhoods in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.Redlining is the discriminatory practice by banks or other financial institutions of denying or avoiding providing credit services to consumers because of the racial or ethnic demographics of the neighborhood in which the consumer lives.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleges that KleinBank violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of race and color in their mortgage lending practices.The complaint alleges that from 2010 to at least 2015, KleinBank structured its residential mortgage lending business in such a way as to avoid serving the credit needs of neighborhoods where a majority of residents are racial and ethnic minorities.The banks alleged redlining practices include: excluding majority-minority neighborhoods from the area it serves; locating branch offices and mortgage loan officers in majority-white neighborhoods, but not in majority-minority neighborhoods; and targeting marketing and advertising exclusively toward residents of majority-white neighborhoods.From 2010 to 2015, comparable lenders generated applications in majority-minority neighborhoods at over five times the rate of KleinBank and made loans in majority-minority neighborhoods at over four times the rate of KleinBank.Redlining produces an unequal and unlevel playing field for borrowers in minority neighborhoods, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. Cases like this one demonstrate the Justice Departments strong commitment to hold banks accountable for continuing and perpetuating historic trends of inequality in residential mortgage lending.
