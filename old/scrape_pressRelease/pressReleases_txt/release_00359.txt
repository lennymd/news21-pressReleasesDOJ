A Detroit, Michigan, resident who owned a janitorial service company was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison today for obstructing the internal revenue laws and failing to file an individual tax return, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division.  According to documents and information provided to the court, from approximately 2001, Braint N. Hall owned Braint N Hall Inc., which also did business as Sunrise Janitorial Service, Sunrise Janitorial and Maintenance Inc. and Detroit Industrial Cleaners Inc. To conceal his ownership of these firms, Hall caused two relatives to establish nominee entities, which he controlled, to assume their business operations, employees, equipment, and client contracts. Despite earning income from these businesses, Hall has not filed individual or corporate income tax returns since 2010. In approximately 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began auditing Hall for his failure to file individual income tax returns and to determine his income tax liability. To obstruct the audit, Hall provided the IRS with false information about the ownership of his janitorial business, the business bank accounts, and its client relationships.  In addition to the term of imprisonment, U.S. District Court Judge David M. Lawson ordered Hall to serve one year of supervised release. Hall pleaded guilty in August 2017 to obstructing the internal revenue laws and failing to file a personal tax return. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman commended special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorneys Kenneth Vert and Jeffrey McLellan of the Tax Division, who prosecuted the case. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman also thanked the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Michigan for its substantial assistance.  None
