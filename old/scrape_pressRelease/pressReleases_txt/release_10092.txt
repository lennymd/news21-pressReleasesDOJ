      WASHINGTON - Eric Bernard Caldwell was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Alabama on charges of conspiracy and theft of government funds, the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.  The indictment was returned on Feb. 16, 2011, and unsealed today.   None       Adamson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft charges on Dec. 2, 2010, and was sentenced to 46 months in prison on March 10, 2011. Another co-conspirator, Jeffery Leon Ceaser, has also pleaded guilty and was sentenced, on March 2, 2011, to 36 months in prison.

If convicted, Caldwell faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.         IRS  Criminal Investigation agents investigated this case, and Tax Division trial attorneys Jason Poole and Michael Boteler are prosecuting the case. None
