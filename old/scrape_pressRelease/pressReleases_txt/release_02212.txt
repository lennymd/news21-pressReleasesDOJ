The Justice Department reached a resolution agreement today with Wheaton College in Massachusetts to ensure the college implements a swift and effective response to allegations of sexual assault and harassment involving students.In August 2015, after receiving a complaint regarding Wheatons handling of a report of sexual assault, the department initiated an investigation and compliance review under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The department reviewed Wheatons handling of sexual assault and harassment complaints over an approximately three and a half-year period, as well as its policies, grievance procedures, training and student education efforts.The agreement details specific steps Wheaton will take to:We commend Wheaton College and President Hanno for their cooperation in our review as well as their work to foster a safe and healthy campus environment where all students can achieve their full potential, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. This agreement will protect the civil rights of all students and ensure the college uses a prompt, fair and reliable process for responding to allegations of sexual assault.
