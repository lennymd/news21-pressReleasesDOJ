  The Department of Justice today announced that three detainees have been transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the custody and control of Georgia.  As directed by the Presidents January 22, 2009 Executive Order, the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force conducted a comprehensive review of these cases. As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, the detainees were approved for transfer by unanimous consent among all the agencies involved in the Task Force. In accordance with Congressionally-mandated reporting requirements, the Administration informed Congress of its intent to transfer these detainees at least 15 days before their transfer.  Earlier today, three detainees, whose identities are being withheld for security and privacy reasons, were transferred to Georgia. The United States is grateful to Georgia for its willingness to support U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.  These transfers were carried out under an arrangement between the United States and Georgia. The United States coordinated with the Georgia to ensure the transfers took place under appropriate security measures and consultations regarding these individuals will continue.  Since 2002, more than 580 detainees have departed Guantanamo Bay for other destinations.
