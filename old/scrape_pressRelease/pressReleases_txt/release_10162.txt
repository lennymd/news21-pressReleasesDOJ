Woods was arrested on Feb. 18, 2011, and appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge John S. Bryant on that date.  Walden was arrested this morning and is currently in state custody.  Wilson, Hall and Williamson are currently in state custody.  Gaddie has not yet been arrested.         With todays indictment, we have charged a total of 32 individuals with committing violent crimes, including murder, to advance the goals of their destructive gang, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  The Bloods, like other street gangs, deal in violence and spread fear throughout our communities.  But with these charges, and others we have announced in recent weeks, we are waging an aggressive fight against such violent organized groups.     The United States Attorneys Office and our law enforcement partners will continue our vigilance directed at organized gangs and those who wreak havoc in our communities by their violent acts, said U.S. Attorney Martin.  Those who choose to become involved in such a lifestyle should know that law enforcement at every level will work together tirelessly to bring them to justice.         If you insist on being involved in criminal activity with gangs and their undeniable acts of violence as alleged in the most recent indictment, be prepared for the consequences. It is only a matter of time until you will become the focal point of an investigation. Our goal is clear and has not changed. ATF and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate those people who perpetuate the violence and remove them from the streets, stated ATF Special Agent in Charge Anderson. Cases like this continue to make communities large and small a safer place for all.       The tireless work of our Gang Unit and other police department investigative components ultimately showed that Bloods members were responsible for violence, including homicides, in more than one area of this city, Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said.  This police department and our partners at the District Attorneys Office and at the federal level will not tolerate this abhorrent behavior in our neighborhoods.            According to the superseding indictment, the defendants were members and associates of the Bloods, a violent street gang that originated in Los Angeles in the 1970s, and ultimately migrated to cities throughout the United States, including Nashville.  The Bloods gang has a hierarchal structure and a long-term and often lethal rivalry with the Crips gang.        The superseding indictment charges that from approximately 2006 until January 2011, Bloods gang members committed and conspired to commit acts of murder, attempted murder, robbery, narcotics trafficking, bribery and extortion.  The superseding indictment alleges that the Bloods gang members met regularly to plan and agree upon the commission of crimes; maintained and circulated a collection of firearms for use in criminal activity by Bloods members; distributed controlled substances including cocaine, cocaine base, marijuana and hydromorphone, and used the proceeds of those drug transactions to help finance the gangs illegal activities.  The superseding indictment also alleges that Bloods gang members committed murder and other acts of violence against rival gang members and others.         The superseding indictment alleges that on June 14, 2008, Wilson shot and killed Michael Goins; on June 25, 2008, Gaddie shot and wounded two known individuals; on July 17, 2008, Wilson and Gaddie shot at a known individual; on July 19, 2008, Wilson, Hall and Woods shot and killed Alexandra Franklin; and on Dec. 20, 2008, Wilson assaulted a known individual during a gang-related incident at the Davidson County Jail.  The superseding indictment also alleges that on Feb. 9, 2009, Williamson shot and wounded a known individual; on May 19, 2009, Williamson shot and killed Andreus Taylor; on Oct. 31, 2009, Williamson carjacked a known individual; and on Feb. 21, 2010, Walden and others,   while armed with various firearms, shot and wounded two known individuals who were in a vehicle in Nashville.         The original indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in June 2010, charged 26 other members and associates of the Bloods with various racketeering, assault and murder charges.  The indictment also   alleged that Lonnie Greenlee, co-founder of the Galaxy Star Drug Awareness and Gang Prevention Center located in Nashville, allowed Bloods gang members to use the facility to conduct gang meetings.    According to the indictment, Lonnie Greenlee and Galaxy Star employee Rodney Britton allegedly provided numerous Bloods gang members with fraudulent documentation of court-ordered community service hours in exchange for money.         An indictment is merely an accusation and is not evidence of guilt.  All defendants have the right to a trial at which the government would have to bear the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.       The case was investigated by the ATF; the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department; the Gallatin Police Department; and assisted by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Davidson County District Attorneys Office.       The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scarlett Singleton and Trial Attorney Cody L. Skipper of the Criminal Divisions Gang Unit.       The public is encouraged to report any information on Gaddies whereabouts to your local police department.
