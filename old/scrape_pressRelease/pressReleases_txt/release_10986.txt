  The Justice Department today announced that it has reached an agreement with Mortons of Chicago/Portland Inc. to settle allegations that it required two non-citizens authorized to work in the United States to present more documents than legally required to establish their work eligibility. Mortons fired the workers after it rejected their valid Social Security cards and demanded to see additional documentation establishing their work authorization. In contrast, Mortons routinely permitted U.S. citizens to present their Social Security cards for this purpose.  Under the terms of the out-of-court settlement, Mortons has agreed to provide full back pay of $2,880 and $5,715.62 to the two employees, pay a civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury of $2,200 and train Mortons Portland employees on federal protections for workers against citizenship status and national origin discrimination. Mortons of Chicago Inc., the parent company, has also agreed to provide complete information about properly conducting the employment eligibility verification process to its managers and employees nationwide who have any role in completing the governments Form I-9 process to determine work authorization.None  "Our nations laws ensure that all individuals who are authorized to work in this country can do so without fear of discrimination or retaliation because of their citizenship status or national origin," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. "The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that all authorized U.S. workers, regardless of citizenship or national origin, are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace."None
