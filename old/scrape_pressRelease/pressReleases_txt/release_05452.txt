A federal court has permanently barred William Naes of St. Charles, Missouri, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The permanent injunction order, to which Naes consented, was entered by U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.The government alleged that Naes prepared returns that fraudulently claimed tax deductions for his customers, including bogus deductions for charitable contributions and unreimbursed employee business expenses. According to the complaint, Naes also fabricated business expenses on Schedules C-Profit or Loss From Business, concocted a fake business for at least one customer and failed to properly identify himself as the paid preparer on many of the returns he prepared. As a result of his conduct, many of Naes customers paid less in taxes than they owed or improperly received tax refunds.NoneRelated Materials:None
