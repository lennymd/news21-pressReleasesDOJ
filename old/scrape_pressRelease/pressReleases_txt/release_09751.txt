None  Frank Lavelle Urbish Jr., 39, aka Thumper, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez to committing a violent crime in aid of racketeering activity.   Specifically, Urbish accepted responsibility for his role in the murder of Mark Davis Byrd Sr.      According to information presented in court, Urbish was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT), a powerful race-based, statewide organization that operates inside and outside of state and federal prisons throughout Texas and the United States.   The ABT enforces its rules and promotes discipline among its members, prospects and associates through murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, assault, robbery and threats against those who violate the rules or pose a threat to the enterprise.   Members, and oftentimes associates, are required to follow the orders of higher-ranking members, often referred to as direct orders.    None   Smith, an ABT member, pleaded guilty on May 11, 2011, to murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the racketeering-related death of Byrd.   McIntyre, a fellow ABT gang member, pleaded guilty to the same charges on Feb. 11, 2011.   At sentencing, Urbish, Smith and McIntyre all face life in prison.   Sentencing for Urbish is scheduled for Sept. 7, 2011.   Smith is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 17, 2011, and McIntyre is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 19, 2011.
