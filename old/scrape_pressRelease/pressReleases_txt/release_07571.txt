Delery, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division.  This settlement demonstrates that the Department of Justice will zealously guard the public fisc  taking action not only against those who fraudulently obtain government funds, but also against those who inappropriately avoid paying money owed to the United States.
