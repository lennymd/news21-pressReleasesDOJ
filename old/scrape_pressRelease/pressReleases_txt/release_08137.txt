None  Redden further acknowledged that he and other correctional officers tried to cover up CERTs role in beating and injuring inmates. Redden stated that more senior officers told him to write a false report and to stick to their cover story when speaking with investigators.  Mr. Redden admitted today that instead of lawfully carrying out his public safety responsibilities, he conspired with fellow officers to assault inmates and then cover up those assaults, said Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute officers who cross the line and engage in criminal misconduct.  When people are incarcerated, the sentence they are required to serve is their time locked up in prison, said U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia Michael J. Moore. It is not a part of their sentence that they be subjected to beatings by the correctional officers. The Department of Justice and I share a zero tolerance policy for those who violate anothers civil rights.  Redden faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. His sentencing date has not yet been set.  This case is being investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Special Litigation Counsel Forrest Christian and Trial Attorney Tona Boyd of the Civil Rights Division of Department of Justice, with the assistance of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Georgia.
