None U.S. Magistrate Judge Camille Vlez-Riv authorized a criminal complaint against Philip Freed, charging him with impersonation of a federal law enforcement officer, entering an airport in violation of security requirements and false statements. The U.S. State Department, Diplomatic Security Services (DSS), with the collaboration of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are in charge of the investigation. According to the criminal complaint, on Sept. 12, Philip Freed falsely pretended to be a law enforcement officer acting under the authority of the United States. Freed gained access to a federally restricted area of the Puerto Rico Airport and made materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations to DSS special agents during the course of the investigation, all while portraying to be a federal law enforcement officer helping with Hurricane Irmas relief efforts. The Diplomatic Security Service is firmly committed to working with the U.S. Attorneys Office to investigate this crime, said Resident Agent in Charge Richard Hays of the DSS San Juan Resident Office. Impersonating a federal law enforcement officer while our nation reels from the recent natural disasters is especially concerning. Our special agents  many of whom still do not have power in their homes  showed exceptional professionalism and dedication as they pursued this case. If convicted, Freed faces up to three years of in prison. A criminal complaint contains only charges and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty. Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc S. Chattah has been assigned to prosecute this case. None
