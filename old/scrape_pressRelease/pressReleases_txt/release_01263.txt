A Blackfoot, Idaho small business owner was sentenced today to 12 months and one day in prison for filing false tax returns, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Rafael M. Gonzalez Jr. for the District of Idaho.  According to documents filed with the court, from approximately 2009 through 2012, Jonathan Peirsol, 42, of Pocatello, Idaho, prepared false individual income tax returns under the name JJ Accounting Inc. Peirsol falsified returns without his clients knowledge or consent by adding items such as medical and education expenses. For some of the returns, Peirsol also diverted -- without his clients knowledge -- portions of the refunds sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), arranging for these to be deposited into a bank account controlled by him. Peirsol also failed to report on his personal tax returns the fees he earned from his tax preparation business.
