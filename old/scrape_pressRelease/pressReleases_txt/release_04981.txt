Today the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other elements of the Intelligence Community, is releasing six Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) documents related to surveillance activities originally authorized by President George W. Bush shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.NoneThe collection of communications content under what has come to be known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) and presidential authorization ended in January 2007 when the U.S. Government transitioned the program to FISA authority under orders of the FISC. The documents released today concern the transition of the TSP from presidential authority to FISC orders between January 2007 and August 2007 and include the FISCs opinions authorizing this collection under Title 1 of FISA.NoneAlthough no longer in effect, the documents disclosed today show the history of the governments post-Sept. 11, 2001, collection of communications content for foreign intelligence purposes. The documents make clear the FISCs independent and searching review of government applications and, together with Congress passage of the PAA and FAA, demonstrate the role of the judicial and legislative branches in regulating executive branch surveillance activities.None
