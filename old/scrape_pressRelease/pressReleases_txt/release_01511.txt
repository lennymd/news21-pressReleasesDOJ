Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the following statement regarding Sundays fatal shooting in New Mexico:We are all saddened to learn of the death on Sunday of Navajo Nation Officer Houston Largo, who was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call. This dedicated young officer chose a life of service to others, despite knowing that each time he put on his badge he might not come home safely. His death reminds us once again that our men and women in law enforcement willingly face danger each day to protect us all  and for this, they deserve our lasting gratitude, respect and support. Our U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Mexico and the FBI are working closely with state and tribal authorities to investigate this tragic incident and ensure that the killer of this brave officer faces justice. My thoughts and prayers, and those of the entire Department of Justice, go out to the family, loved ones and colleagues of Officer Largo.
