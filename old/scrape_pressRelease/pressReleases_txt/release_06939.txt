The Justice Department announced today that it has reached a settlement with SuperShuttle, a shared-ride transportation company based in Arizona, to resolve a complaint that it discriminated against a blind person who uses a service animal. Specifically, the Justice Department determined that SuperShuttle violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by forcing a blind person who uses a service animal and her party to ride in a separate van and charging them a higher rate than other individuals who are allowed to share a van and pay a reduced fare.Americans with disabilities are entitled to the same opportunities that others have and the Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities are treated equally, said Eve L. Hill, Senior Counselor to the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. We are pleased that SuperShuttle has committed to taking affirmative steps to remedy this situation throughout its company.Under the terms of the settlement agreement, SuperShuttle will adopt a revised service animal non-discrimination policy; train all employees, franchisees and independent contractors on the requirements of the ADA; and pay $1,000 in damages to the complainant.NoneSettlement Agreement
