The Department of Justice and United States Attorneys Office reached a settlement agreement today with the DeKalb County, Georgia, school district to resolve the departments inquiry into the districts ability to prevent and effectively respond to peer-on-peer harassment based on national origin and religion.NoneThe agreement requires, among other things, that the DeKalb County school district develop and implement annual age and position appropriate trainings on religious and national origin harassment for all students, staff who interact with students (including administrators, teachers, counselors, and bus drivers), and district-level administrators who interact with students or who are involved in addressing harassment or bullying in the district. The training will include topics related to post-9/11 backlash and harassment that perpetuates negative stereotypes impacting the Sikh, Muslim, Arab-American and South Asian communities.We commend the DeKalb County School Districts commitment to ensuring that all students  including Sikhs, Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians  can grow and learn in a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination based on religion or national origin, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division. DeKalb County school district has worked hand-in-hand with the department to identify and expand those policies that are successful at protecting kids while modifying those practices that need improvement, and we are confident that the district will continue its work to eliminate harassment in its schools.Every child should be able to attend school without the fear of being taunted and physically assaulted based on his religion or national origin, said United States Attorney Sally Quillian Yates for the Northern District of Georgia. I am encouraged that DeKalb County School District has demonstrated a commitment to ensure that its schools are free of harassment.NoneAssistant United States Attorney Aileen Bell Hughes handled this matter on behalf of the United States Attorneys Office.None
