NoneThese sentences send a strong message that criminal violations of environmental laws designed to protect human health from exposure to hazardous substances, such as asbestos, will not be tolerated, said U.S. Attorney Killian. Those individuals who choose to place profit over compliance with our nations environmental laws will be vigorously prosecuted and brought to justice.Exposure to asbestos can cause serious, even fatal, illnesses so it must be removed safely and in accordance with the law, said Maureen OMara, Special Agent in Charge of EPAs criminal enforcement program in Tennessee. The defendants in this case not only lied to authorities and tried to cover up their actions, but they also hired homeless and untrained workers to perform the illegal asbestos removal activities, endangering both the employees and the greater community. Todays sentences show that those who break the law and put the public at risk to make illegal profits will face serious consequences.None
