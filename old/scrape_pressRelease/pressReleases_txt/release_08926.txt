The BA is primarily based in West Texas; Juarez, Mexico; and throughout state and federal prisons in the United States and Mexico.  The gang has a militaristic command structure and includes captains, lieutenants, sergeants, soldiers and associates  all with the purpose of maintaining power and enriching its members and associates through drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, intimidation, violence, threats of violence and murder.       According to court documents, members and associates of the BA have engaged in a host of criminal activity committed since Jan. 1, 2003, including drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, kidnapping and murder, including the March 13, 2010, murders in Juarez of U.S. consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton, her husband Arthur Redelfs and Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of a U.S. consulate employee.       The BA profits by importing heroin, cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Mexico.  Gang members and associates also allegedly charge a street tax or cuota on businesses and criminals operating in their turf.  These profits are used to support gang members in prison by funneling money into prison commissary accounts of gang leaders and to pay for defense lawyers or fines.  The cuota profits are also allegedly reinvested into the organization to purchase drugs, guns and ammunition.      According to information presented in court, as a BA officer,   Jesus Espino   helped coordinate the distribution of marijuana, cocaine and heroin in the Western District of Texas and elsewhere.  Lorenzo Espino assisted in the distribution of heroin while Cervantes distributed heroin and paid street tax to the BA for protection.  Cardona helped distribute BA proceeds to members incarcerated in the state and federal prison systems.
