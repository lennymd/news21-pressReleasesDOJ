      WASHINGTON  Responding to the Presidents and Attorney Generals call for increased transparency, federal agencies across the government have released more documents, made more information available on websites and decreased backlogs in the past year, the Department of Justice today announced.  This year, for the first time ever, 94 agencies were required to submit reports from their Chief FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) Officers detailing their progress in improving transparency as part of the Presidents FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney Generals FOIA Guidelines.
