The United States has asked a federal court to permanently bar a Colorado man and the tax preparation business he operates from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.According to the governments civil complaint, Gerardo Herrera and his business, El Lobo Multiservicios Professionales Inc., fraudulently reduced their customers tax liabilities by reporting extra dependents and claiming bogus deductions. For example, the complaint alleges that Herrera and his staff have repeatedly claimed their customers extended family members as dependents, even though they do not qualify for dependent status under federal law, and have improperly claimed deductions for personal expenses like cell phones and car insurance. In addition, according to the complaint, audits have shown that Herrera and his workers exaggerated deductions, reported fraudulent charitable contribution deductions and claimed improper head of household filing status. The complaint alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited more than 200 returns prepared by Herreras business and found misrepresentations on more than 99 percent of them.None
