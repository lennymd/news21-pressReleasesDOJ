Today a federal court in Jackson, Mississippi permanently barred Christopher Chamberlin from preparing federal tax returns for others. In addition to enjoining Chamberlin from preparing, filing, or assisting in the preparation or filing of federal tax returns and amended returns, the court ordered Chamberlin to deliver a copy of the injunction to all customers for whom he prepared a return after Jan. 1, 2014, and deliver a list of those customers to the United States. The court also ordered Chamberlin to turn over copies of all returns he prepared since Jan. 1, 2014, to the United States.NoneNone
