      WASHINGTON  Four corporations involved in owning and operating a fleet of vessels regularly visiting New Orleans pleaded guilty today and agreed to pay a $1 million penalty and be banned from doing business in the United States for the next five years under the terms of a proposed plea agreement.   None       According to the plea agreement, subject to approval by the court, the four corporations will be prohibited from further business in the United States during the maximum five year period of probation. The plea terms also require personal banning of the owner of the companies who is also a corporate officer in some of the companies owning or technically managing vessels during the probationary period.  Of the $1 million penalty, $250,000 will be devoted to community service payments to help conservation, protection, restoration and management projects to benefit fish and wildlife habitats and resources in the Eastern District of Louisiana.

After a voyage in which the ship had lost power for several days at sea, the ship arrived at the Southwest Pass, La.  The master, who opposed proceeding to port until the problem was corrected, was directed by a shore-side manager to write an email indicating that the ship had two generators.  This was communicated to the Coast Guard which then allowed the ship to enter the Mississippi River.  However, the agency was not told that neither of the two generators was fully operational or able to power the ship, and that there was no backup since a third generator was completely inoperable.  Because of the hazardous situation, the master ordered tug boats to guide the ship into port. None         Together with our partners at the Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency, and United States Attorneys Office, we are sending the message that we will vigorously prosecute deliberate violations of environmental and safety laws, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice.  As a consequence of their violations of the law, Stanships vessels and related corporations will pay a substantial fine and be barred from doing business in the United States for the next five years.        The endangerment of our environment and quality of life resulting from repeat offenders is simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  We will work aggressively with our partners in the U.S. Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division, U. S. Coast Guard and EPA Criminal Investigative Division to ensure that our water, our rivers and wetlands remain safe for our citizens and for future generations, said Jim Letten, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana.              The outcome of this case clearly demonstrates the Coast Guard's commitment to work with our interagency partners to aggressively enforce all maritime anti-pollution laws.  These federal laws are in place to protect the marine environment and America's waterways.  It is especially disappointing to see a repeat offender violate these laws.  This case is a testament to the dedication of all persons who were involved in resolving this matter including my legal staff, Coast Guard Investigative Service, Coast Guard Sector New Orleans, the U.S Department of Justice Environmental Crimes Section and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said Rear Adm. Mary E. Landry, Eighth District Coast Guard commander.       Todays action demonstrates that neither the government nor the public will tolerate the flagrant and repeated violation of U.S. laws, said Ivan J. Vikin, Special Agent in Charge of EPAs criminal enforcement program in Louisiana. The government contends that the defendant not only failed to carry out the terms of its probation, it knowingly released oil into our oceans after the sentence was passed. The oceans must be protected from shipping companies that look to cut corners by dumping waste improperly.     No matter how vast they seem, aquatic resources are still finite and the Coast Guard Investigative Service remains committed to their preservation, said Damon Rodriguez, Coast Guard Investigative Service Gulf Region special agent in charge.       This case was investigated criminally by the U.S. Coast Guard Criminal Investigative Services and the EPA Criminal Investigation Division, with assistance from Sector New Orleans, Eight Coast Guard District Office of the Judge Advocate.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Emily K. Greenfield and Dorothy Manning Taylor, and Senior Trial Attorney Richard A. Udell of the Environmental Crimes Section of Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division.
