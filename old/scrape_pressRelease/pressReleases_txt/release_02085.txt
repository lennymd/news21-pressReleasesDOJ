The Justice Department reached an agreement today with the University of New Mexico (UNM) to ensure that UNM responds swiftly and effectively to allegations of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, involving students. The agreement resolves the departments findings of UNMs non-compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.NoneNo student should ever feel afraid or unsafe at school because his or her campus fails to effectively respond to sexual assault and harassment, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We commend UNM for taking proactive steps to ensure that the entire community of students, staff and faculty fully understand the universitys obligation to respond fairly, promptly and reliably to all incidents of sexual assault and harassment.We are deeply committed to civil rights enforcement, and sexual assault and sexual harassment are civil rights issues, said U.S. Attorney Damon P. Martinez of the District of New Mexico. Students have the right to live and learn in a safe educational environment, and this agreement provides the foundation that UNM will build on to ensure that this right is both recognized and respected.UNM fully cooperated with the departments investigation and in crafting an agreement that will provide for accountability to the public and for prompt and effective implementation of remedial measures.NoneNoneNone
