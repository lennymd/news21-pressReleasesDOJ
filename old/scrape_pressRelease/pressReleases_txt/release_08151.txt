      Nacretia Lewis was sentenced today to 15 months in federal prison for perjury and lying to a federal agent, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced.  She was also ordered to serve one year of supervised release following her release from prison.       On March 27, 2012, after a two-day jury trial, Lewis was convicted of one count of perjury and one count of lying to a federal agent. Based on evidence introduced at trial, Lewis earlier appeared as a witness in a September 2011 trial in the Middle District of Alabama, and testified falsely in favor of an alibi defense offered by the defendant, Janika Fernae Bates. Specifically, Lewis was convicted of lying about being with Janika Fernae Bates at a place other than NCO Financial Systems Inc., their workplace on Jan. 20, 2011, at precisely the same time other witnesses placed Bates at NCO fleeing from federal law enforcement attempting to execute a federal arrest warrant.        The evidence further showed that after her false testimony at trial, Lewis met with federal agents and again lied about her whereabouts and Bates whereabouts on Jan. 20, 2011. Despite Lewis false alibi testimony at the Bates trial, Janika Fernae Bates was convicted of 13 felony counts related to stolen identity refund fraud and sentenced to 94 months in federal prison.       Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, thanked special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Justin Gelfand and Jason Poole, who prosecuted the case.
