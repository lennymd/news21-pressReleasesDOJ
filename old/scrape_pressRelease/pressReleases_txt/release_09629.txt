      WASHINGTON  A federal court has permanently barred Aurelia Sanderson Johnson from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  The civil injunction order, to which Johnson consented, was signed by Judge Mark E. Fuller of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.  The court also ordered Johnson to provide a list of her customers to the government and to mail a copy of the court order to each person for whom she prepared a federal income tax return since Jan. 1, 2007.
