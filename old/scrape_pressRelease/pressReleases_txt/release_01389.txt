Monahan participated in this scheme from in or about January 2008 until in or about February 2014. Patric Monahan knowingly participated in a long-standing scheme to defraud U.S. financial institutions, said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect U.S. companies from fraud, wherever we find it.The plea filed today reflects the FBIs steadfast commitment to ferreting out all forms of financial institution fraud and sends a strong message for those seeking new ways to steal from banks: you will be caught and held accountable for your crimes, said Special Agent in Charge Richard T. Thornton of the Minneapolis office of the FBI.This is the first case involving fraud and kickbacks relating to repair contracts for properties in the Minneapolis area owned by financial institutions. The maximum penalty for wire fraud is 30 years of imprisonment and a fine of $1,000,000. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.None
