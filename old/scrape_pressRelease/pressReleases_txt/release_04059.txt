NoneToday, the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the equality, dignity and essential humanity of our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and reaffirmed this countrys bedrock principle  engraved over the entrance to the Court itself  that all Americans are entitled to equal justice under law. By putting an end to an era of state-sanctioned discrimination, the decisionlights the way toa future of acceptance, inclusion and opportunity for gay and lesbian Americans and their families. Itencapsulatesa nations enormous leap of understanding  rooted in compassion, tolerance and empathy  and reflects the countless hearts touched and minds opened along the way. It vindicates an idea whose time has come at last.Todays result would not have been possible without the passionate advocacy and innumerable acts of personal bravery of generations of leaders, who have fought for the simple freedom to pursue their own happiness with thosewhomthey love. Their fight, galvanized by the Stonewall riots nearly a half-century ago, was waged in the face of pervasive bigotry and widespread resistance and its progress was never guaranteed. But after too many lifetimes of isolation, humiliation and harassment  and steeled by unimaginable courage andindomitableconviction  gay and lesbian citizens across the country bravely came out into the openand awakened the conscience of a nation. Their courage has led us to thisday; to a decision fromthe nations highest courtdeclaring themto havefull and equalrights to marryin the country they fought to change; and to a victory that they have justly and finally won.None
