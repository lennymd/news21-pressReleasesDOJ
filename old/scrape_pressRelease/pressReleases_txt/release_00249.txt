The Justice Department today announced it has reached a settlement with Food Love 125 Inc., d/b/a Ichiba Ramen, a New York City restaurant, to resolve the Departments investigation into whether the restaurant violated the Immigration and Nationality Acts (INA) anti-discrimination provision.A workers complaint initiated the Justice Departments investigation, which revealed that Ichiba Ramens former chef discriminated against a job applicant when it refused to hire him as a server because he is not Korean or Japanese. The investigation also revealed that prior chefs had not placed such limitations on the restaurants hiring of servers. The INAs anti-discrimination provision prohibits employers with four to 14 employees from discriminating against individuals because of their national origin.Under the settlement agreement, Ichiba Ramen will pay a civil penalty, undergo training on the INAs anti-discrimination provision, and post notices informing workers about their rights under the INA. The restaurant also paid $1,760 in back pay to compensate the affected applicant.Todays settlement should serve as a reminder to small employers that hiring discrimination based on national origin violates the INAs anti-discrimination provision, and the Justice Department is committed to holding employers accountable for such violations, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to retaliation; different documentary requirements based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status, or national origin in hiring, firing, or recruitment or referral for a fee, should contact IERs worker hotline for assistance.
