Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Monday on the resignation of U.S. Attorney Tim Heaphy for the Western District of Virginia:Over the past five years, Tim Heaphy has been an outstanding United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia and a key national leader on a host of pressing criminal justice issues.Throughout his distinguished career -- from our days together in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia, to his current post -- I have known Tim as a dedicated public servant and a champion of the cause of justice. He has been a fierce advocate for groundbreaking community outreach initiatives within and far beyond his district. And he has worked tirelessly to promote data-driven prevention, intervention, and reentry programs to improve public safety at the national level.As a talented attorney, a dedicated prosecutor, and a leader of both patriotism and principle, Tim Heaphy has been an indispensable member of the U.S. Department of Justice. From the prosecutions he has led to the policies he has championed, Tim's work has touched countless lives across Virginia and throughout the nation. I have been proud to count him as a friend. On behalf of our colleagues and the American people, I thank him for his service and wish him all the best in every future endeavor.
