      Nakia Jackson pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of aggravated identity theft for his role in a stolen identity refund fraud scheme, announced Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally of the Justice Department's Tax Division, U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr. for the Middle District of Alabama and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).       According to court documents, between January 2009 and March 2011, Jackson obtained stolen identities from an Alabama state employee and used those identities to file false tax returns. Jackson recruited a bank employee, LaQuanta Clayton, to assist him in having the false income tax refunds deposited into various bank accounts. He obtained permission from several individuals to use their bank accounts to receive false refunds and when a false refund was deposited, Jackson would direct the individuals to withdraw the money and give the money to him. In total, Jackson filed over 100 false tax returns and requested over $400,000 in refunds.        Sentencing has been scheduled for April 23, 2014. Jackson faces a statutory minimum sentence of two years in prison and a statutory maximum sentence of 12 years in prison, three years of supervised release, restitution and a maximum fine of $250,000, or twice the loss caused by the offense. LaQuanta Clayton has already pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.        IRS-Criminal Investigation agents investigated this case and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Charles M. Edgar Jr. and Michael Boteler and Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Brown are prosecuting the case. None
