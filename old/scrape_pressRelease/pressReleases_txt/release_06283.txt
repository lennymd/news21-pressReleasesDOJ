NoneNoneNone  Assistant Attorney General Delery thanked the Office of Chief Counsel for the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida, the Justice Departments Commercial Litigation Branch, the Defense Health Agency, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General for the collaboration that resulted in the settlement.  This settlement illustrates the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by Attorney General Eric Holder and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $17 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $12.2 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.  The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. The two lawsuits are captioned United States ex rel. Fuentes, Russo v. Genzyme Corp., No. 09-cv-1245 (M.D. Fla.) and United States ex rel. Kelley v. Genzyme Corp., No. 10-cv-549 (M.D. Fla.).
