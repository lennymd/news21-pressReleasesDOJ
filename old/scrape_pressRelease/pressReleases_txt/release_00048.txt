Its that time of year again: tax season. The Justice Department would like to remind the public during this time of year that evading your tax obligations could end badly, with substantial fines and penalties, and even long prison sentences. Taxpayers are also reminded to be on the lookout for unscrupulous tax return preparers, who seek to inflate refunds by falsifying deductions, among other means. Even if a tax return preparer makes an error on an individuals tax return, it is still the taxpayers responsibility to pay the correct taxes, and that individual may still be responsible for any unpaid taxes, interest, and fines resulting from these crimes. Tax returns are signed under the penalties of perjury, and every taxpayer is ultimately responsible for the contents of his or her own return, cautioned Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division. While the vast majority of Americans truthfully report and pay their taxes, unfortunately there are those who seek to cheat the system and take a free ride on the backs of the hard working men and women of this country. The Justice Department is committed to bringing tax evaders and those who falsely prepare tax returns to justice. Over the past year, federal prosecutors for the Tax Division and U.S. Attorneys offices across the country have worked tirelessly with special agents of Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation and other law enforcements agencies to investigate and prosecute those who illegally evade their taxes. These enforcement efforts continue year round.
