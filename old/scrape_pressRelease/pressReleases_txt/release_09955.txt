  WASHINGTON  A federal court in Los Angeles has permanently barred William Alexander of Pasadena, Calif., and his two companies, Retirement Plan Services Inc. and Lyons Pensions Inc., from selling or administering pension plans or employee welfare-benefit plans, the Justice Department announced today. The courts order, to which Alexander and his companies consented, also prohibits Alexander from preparing federal tax returns for others for a fee or representing others before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). None   The civil injunction order also requires Alexander to provide copies of the courts order to anyone to whom he provided tax advice since Jan. 1, 2005, and for whom he has or can readily obtain a mail or e-mail address.
