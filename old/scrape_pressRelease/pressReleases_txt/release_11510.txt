  Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement today in recognition of Martin Luther King Day:  "Each year, Martin Luther King Day provides an opportunity for all Americans to rededicate ourselves to Dr. Kings dream of racial, social, and economic justice. Today is also a reminder of the power and importance of service to others. Dr. Kings example, and his enduring legacy, offer proof that the contributions of a single person can help to improve and inspire an entire nation.  "Without question, there are great needs to be met in America and beyond. Just this week, with the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti, we have been reminded that the work of helping others often extends beyond our borders. In the aftermath of this disaster, the outpouring of compassion, resources, and relief-delivery efforts from across our country are evidence that, even during tough economic times, the American spirit of giving remains strong.  "One of the most meaningful ways we can give life to Dr. Kings dreams is by seeking out opportunities to serve and empower others. Today, I am volunteering with DCs Youth Service Opportunities Project to prepare and serve breakfast to the homeless. I encourage everyone who has a holiday from work or class to help make sure that Martin Luther King Day is not simply a day off., it is truly a day on. Together, we can ensure it becomes a day of national service and an occasion to carry on Dr. Kings work today and into the future."None
