  The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that Anthony Chaudhuri and Margaret Chaudhuri, of Naples, Fla., pleaded guilty today to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the United States.  According to court documents, the Chaudhuris owned and operated a hospital inventory control software company under the name Ariel Computing and various other nominee names, including ADI. Ariel Computing was operated from various addresses in Ann Arbor, Mich. Court documents indicate that between 1996 and 2008, the Chaudhuris withheld approximately $888,353 in employment taxes from Ariel Computing employees, but failed to pay over to the IRS approximately $704,488 of these withheld taxes, instead diverting those funds for their own personal use.  At sentencing, the Chaudhuris face a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the conspiracy charge. A sentencing date has not yet been set.  Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended the efforts of special agents IRSCriminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Tax Division Trial Attorneys Tiwana Wright and Mark McDonald, who are prosecuting the case.
