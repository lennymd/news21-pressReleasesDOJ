A federal district judge in the Statesboro Division of the Southern District of Georgia has permanently barred Lakesia Michelle Mills of Adrian, Ga., from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The injunction also requires Mills to send copies of the injunction to her customers.According to the complaint filed by the department on Nov. 1, 2013, Mills is a paid tax return preparer who does business as Willis Tax Service. The complaint alleges that, since January 2011, Mills has prepared at least 455 amended federal income tax returns that claimed overstated refunds based upon fabricated First-Time Homebuyer Credit claims for $8,000, which is the maximum amount. Mills also allegedly provided customers with false settlement statements and proof of insurance to support the credit. The complaint also alleges that Mills failed to sign the returns she prepared or to include her tax preparer identification number as required. Altogether, Mills allegedly claimed over $3.6 million in bogus credits on the amended returns. Mills consented to the entry of the injunction without admitting to any findings of fact.NoneRelated Materials:None
