      WASHINGTON - Lawrence R. Marino, a 41-year-old from Goffstown, N.H., pleaded guilty today in federal court to computer intrusion, stemming from his repeated hacks into his former employers computer systems, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Michael J. Gunnison for the District of New Hampshire.       Marino pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Steven J. McAuliffe in Concord, N.H., to a one-count criminal information charging him with computer intrusion.         Marino admitted at the plea hearing that from May 2009 through September 2009, he repeatedly hacked into the computer systems of his former employer, OneSky Jets. OneSky, which is based in Manchester, N.H., provides charter flight services to customers around the country.  According to the criminal information, while employed at OneSky, Marino acquired other employees log-in credentials for their OneSky email accounts.  After Marinos employment at OneSky was terminated, he began working for a Regent Jet, a competitor private jet company.   While employed at Regent Jet, Marino repeatedly accessed the email accounts of OneSky employees and obtained information about OneSkys existing and prospective customers.  Marino also hacked into OneSkys computer system and obtained a copy of a database with tens of thousands of customer names and other information.  According to the court document, Marino used this illegally-obtained customer information to then solicit new customers on behalf of Regent Jet.       A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 17, 2011, at 11:30 a.m. EDT.  At sentencing, Marino faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, and restitution.       The case was investigated by the FBI.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Arnold Huftalen of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of New Hampshire and Mona Sedky of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Justice Departments Criminal Division.
