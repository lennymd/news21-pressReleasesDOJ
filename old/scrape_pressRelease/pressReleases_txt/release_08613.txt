  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced today that the Civil Rights Division will monitor elections today in Cuyahoga, Hamilton and Lorain Counties, Ohio. The monitoring will ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The Voting Rights Act prohibits discrimination in the election process on the basis of race, color or membership in a minority language group. The Help America Vote Act includes requirements regarding provisional ballots during elections for federal office.  Under the Voting Rights Act, the Justice Department is authorized to ask the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to send federal observers to jurisdictions that are certified by the attorney general or by a federal court order. Federal observers will be assigned to monitor polling place activities in Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties based on court orders. The observers will watch and record activities during voting hours at polling locations, and Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate the federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.  In addition, Justice Department personnel will monitor polling place activities in Hamilton County. A Civil Rights Division attorney will coordinate federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.  Each year, the Justice Department deploys hundreds of federal observers from OPM, as well as departmental staff, to monitor elections across the country. To file complaints about discriminatory voting practices, including acts of harassment or intimidation, voters may call the Voting Section of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division at 1-800-253-3931.None
