  The Department of Justice announced today that it has reached a settlement with eBay Inc. that prevents the company from entering into or maintaining agreements with other companies restraining employee recruitment and hiring.     The departments Antitrust Division filed the proposed settlement in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose.   If approved by the court, the settlement would resolve the departments competitive concerns and the original lawsuit filed on Nov. 16, 2012.None   In the high technology sector, employees with advanced or specialized skills are highly valued and sought after.   Companies often heavily recruit and hire experienced and capable employees of other technology firms, offering significantly better job opportunities or pay.   The agreement between eBay and Intuit diminished important competition between the firms to attract highly skilled technical and other employees to the detriment of affected employees who had less access to better job opportunities and higher pay.   None None   The proposed settlement would prohibit eBay from entering or maintaining anticompetitive agreements relating to employee hiring and retention for five years.   It would broadly prohibit eBay from entering, maintaining or enforcing any agreement that in any way prevents any person from soliciting, cold calling, recruiting, hiring or otherwise competing for employees.   eBay will also implement compliance measures tailored to these practices. Intuit is already subject to a similar consent decree, and for that reason was not a defendant in this case.NoneNone         eBay Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Jose, Calif.   The proposed settlement, along with the departments competitive impact statement, will be published in The Federal Register, as required by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act.   Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days of its publication to James J. Tierney, Chief, Networks & Technology Enforcement Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street N.W., Suite 7100, Washington D.C. 20530.
