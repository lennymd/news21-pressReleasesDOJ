None None None This Office will not tolerate anyone who seeks to stack the deck against American workers and products, said U.S. Attorney Bobby L. Christine for the Southern District of Georgia. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, as well as our colleagues in the Civil Division, to pursue those who believe that their own profit justifies evasion of federal antidumping duties. CBP is appreciative of information received from the public regarding fraudulent trade activity. This type of blatant disregard for trade laws and regulations severely impacts the US economy by giving these bad actors an unfair advantage over legitimate importers, said Donald F. Yando Director of Field Operations for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Atlanta Field Office. CBP is committed to working with our partners both inside and outside the government to help bolster the US economy by putting an end to this type of illegal activity. None None None
