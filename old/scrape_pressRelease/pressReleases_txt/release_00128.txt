The Justice Department today reached a settlement agreement with Union Parish Detention Center (UPDC), a correctional facility located in Farmerville, Louisiana.The settlement agreement resolves a complaint under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that UPDC held a detainee with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in isolated, segregated housing for approximately six months because he has HIV. UPDC cooperated with the Department throughout the investigation.Under the agreement, UPDC will not segregate detainees in the future on the basis of their HIV status. The agreement also requires UPDC to adopt nondiscrimination policies, designate an ADA coordinator, establish an ADA complaint procedure, and train all staff annually on HIV and nondiscrimination obligations. In addition, UPDC will pay $27,500 in damages to the complainant.This agreement ensures that Union Parish Detention Center will respect the right of individuals with HIV to equal treatment under the law, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division. Segregation of detainees with HIV in jails or prisons is unlawful, subjects individuals to unwarranted stigma and harm, and will not be tolerated by this Justice Department.None
