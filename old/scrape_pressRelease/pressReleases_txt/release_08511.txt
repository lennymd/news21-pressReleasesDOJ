WASHINGTON  Mark Gautreau, 50, was sentenced today in federal court in New Orleans to 72 months in prison for shooting two Hispanic men on the Bonnet Carre Spillway in St. Charles Parish, La., on Aug. 20, 2006. In November 2011, Gautreau pleaded guilty to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.In the factual basis supporting his plea, Gautreau admitted he was in a parking lot in the spillway when he told a bystander that he intended to shoot some Mexicans. Gautreau admitted that he then loaded ammunition into his 12-gauge shotgun and drove off toward the area where four Hispanic men were fishing. Once he reached them, Gautreau got out of his truck and fired his shotgun one time. The shotgun blast hit two of the Hispanic men, who suffered injuries that required hospitalization. Gautreau admitted that the four Hispanic men did not shoot at him or threaten him in any way that would require him to defend himself.Justice has been met for the two Hispanic men who were the victims of a random act of violence, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The department is committed to vigorously enforcing our nations civil rights laws. Together with our partners in the Civil Rights Division, who led this important prosecution, and the FBI, we will remain true to our commitment to fiercely protect the rights of all within our borders to be free from abuse and violence, said James Letten, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana.This case was investigated by the New Orleans office of the FBI.
