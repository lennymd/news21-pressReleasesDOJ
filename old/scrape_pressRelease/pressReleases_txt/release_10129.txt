None None None    When Vernon Wilson goes to prison, he should not experience the same vulnerability he made his victims feel, said Dennis L. Baker, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI St. Louis Division. Fortunately, the vast majority of the men and women who swore to uphold the law are not like him.       Wilsons daughter, Valeria Wilson Jackson, 26, previously pleaded guilty on July 14, 2010, to one count of obstruction of justice for lying to the FBI about her   role in one of the beatings.      The case was investigated by the St. Louis Division of the FBI   and was prosecuted by Fara Gold and Patricia Sumner of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
