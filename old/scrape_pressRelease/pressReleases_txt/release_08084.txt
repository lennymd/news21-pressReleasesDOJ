    Charles C. LoBello, a Nevada-licensed attorney who practices business and personal injury law in Las Vegas, pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of tax evasion, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. U.S. District Court Judge James Mahan presided over the plea hearing.     On June 22, 2010, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against LoBello, charging him with five counts of tax evasion and five counts of filing false personal income tax returns, for the tax years 2001 through 2005.     According to court documents, LoBello concealed over $900,000 in income from the United States, intentionally gave incomplete information to his bookkeeper and tax return preparer, and used personal checking accounts to hide large checks he received as legal fees. In the plea agreement, LoBello admitted that for the years 2001 through 2005 he owed an additional $260,625 in income taxes.     Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 23, 2012. LoBello faces a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. According to the plea agreement, LoBello has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $260,625 to the IRS, which represents his unpaid personal income tax liability for 2001 through 2005. He also agreed to pay all applicable interest and penalties on that tax liability.
