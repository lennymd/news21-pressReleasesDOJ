A federal judge sentenced a Long Island, New York sales representative to prison for fraudulently selling vending machine businesses, the Justice Department announced today.  Richard R. Goldberg, 44, of Holbrook, New York, was sentenced to serve 36 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $546,487.77 in restitution by U.S. District Court Judge Joan M. Azrack of the Eastern District of New York. Goldberg was found guilty after a six-week trial in 2015 of wire fraud and conspiracy. He is one of 24 defendants who have been convicted of fraud in connection with Multivend LLC d/b/a/ Vendstar, which was based in Deer Park, New York.  The defendant enticed people to pay $10,000 or more for a business that he promised would be prosperous, when he knew it was likely to fail, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler, head of the Justice Departments Civil Division. That is a serious and reprehensible crime. The Department of Justice is committed to protecting consumers by prosecuting such frauds. None Acting Assistant Attorney General Readler commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for its thorough investigation. The case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Patrick Jasperse and Assistant Director Alan Phelps of the Civil Divisions Consumer Protection Branch. During the last 10 years, approximately 170 individuals have been convicted of fraudulently selling business opportunities in cases prosecuted by the Consumer Protection Branch.
