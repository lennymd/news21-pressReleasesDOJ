WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced a comprehensive settlement agreement with McNeese State University and the Board of Supervisors of the University of Louisiana System under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).The settlement agreement resolves a compliance review initiated by the United States in 2008.

Under the agreement, McNeese, a public university located in Lake Charles, La., will continue its efforts to come into compliance with the access provisions of Title II of the ADA. The university will take a number of steps to improve access for students, visitors and employees with disabilities including:In addition to the specific remedial work required by this agreement, the board of supervisors (in conjunction with the Louisiana Division of Administration/Office of Facility Planning) has commenced procedural changes to emphasize ADA accessibility rules and regulations for capital outlay projects for the University of Louisiana System."Full access to all programs and services is a civil right enjoyed by all, including individuals with disabilities. We are pleased that McNeese is taking steps to ensure that individuals with disabilities are guaranteed full access to its programs, services and activities, and we applaud the board of supervisors for taking steps to ensure access at all of the University of Louisiana campuses," said Thomas Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division."This a positive move by McNeese and the board of supervisors.
