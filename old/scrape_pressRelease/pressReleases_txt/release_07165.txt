None       The departments Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota against CASD. At the same time, the department filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the lawsuit.       Chiropractic Associates Ltd. of South Dakota negotiated contracts on behalf of all its members, including competing providers, resulting in increased prices for chiropractic services in South Dakota, said Bill Baer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. Todays settlement promotes competition among health care providers and prevents collective action that harms consumers and violates the antitrust laws.         According to the complaint, since 1997, CASD collectively negotiated the rates and price-related terms for at least seven contracts with insurers on behalf of CASDs members. Except for members who were part of the same practice groups, CASDs members were not clinically or financially integrated, and CASDs actions were not necessary to achieve any benefits for consumers.          The proposed settlement will prevent CASD from establishing prices or terms for chiropractic services and from negotiating with insurers on behalf of competing chiropractors. The proposed settlement will also require CASD to terminate its current payer contracts at various specified times, but in no event later than three months after the court's entry of the final judgment.None       The proposed settlement, along with the departments competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register as required by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act. Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days of its publication to Peter J. Mucchetti, Chief, Litigation I Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Suite 4100, Washington, D.C. 20530. At the conclusion of the 60-day comment period, the court may enter the final judgment upon finding that it serves the public interest.
