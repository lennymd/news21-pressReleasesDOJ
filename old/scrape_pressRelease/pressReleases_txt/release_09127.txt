  WASHINGTON  A federal court in the Middle District of Louisiana has permanently barred Cynthia Peters and Melissa Edwards from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. According to the civil injunction suit, Peters, Edwards and their business, Jasmines and Melissas Tax Service, prepared tax returns for their customers claiming fraudulent tax refunds based on improperly claimed earned income tax credits.   The suit alleges that Peters and Edwards, both of Baton Rouge, La., prepared tax returns that claimed fraudulent refunds by fabricating their customers income and creating bogus losses and expenses so that the customers would supposedly qualify for the earned income credit. The pair also allegedly manufactured bogus losses and expenses for fictitious businesses so that their customers could claim larger refunds. The lawsuit alleges that their misconduct caused over $7 million in harm to the government. None None
