Attorney General Jeff Sessions today issued the following statement on President Trump directing the administration to use all appropriate authority to respond to the opioid emergency:I applaud President Trump for his leadership in taking this drastic and necessary measure to confront an opioid crisis that is devastating communities around the country and ripping families apart. The death toll of this horrific epidemic reached 60,000 people in 2016, but as horrible as it is to think of that number, it is worse when we look past the staggering statistic and see our children, our moms and dads, sisters and brothers, friends and co-workers. This nation has never seen overdose deaths anywhere close to these numbers, and for each death, many more suffer debilitating addictions.Just last week the Department of Justice announced its new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit and we continue to follow the Presidents lead and use every tool we have to combat this deadly crisis.
