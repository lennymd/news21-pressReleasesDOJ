None  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced today that it will monitor municipal elections on May 8, 2010, in Dallas and Galveston Counties, Texas, to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The act prohibits discrimination in the election process on the basis of race, color or membership in a minority language group. In addition, the act requires certain covered jurisdictions, including Dallas and Galveston Counties, to provide language assistance in Spanish during the election process. Galveston County is also subject to a court order entered in 2007 that requires the jurisdiction to comply with the minority language requirements of the Voting Rights Act.  Under the Voting Rights Act, the Justice Department is authorized to ask the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to send federal observers to areas that are specially covered in the act itself or by a federal court order. Federal observers will be assigned to monitor polling place activities in these counties based on the attorney generals certification. The observers will watch and record activities during voting hours at polling locations in these jurisdictions, and Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate the federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.None
