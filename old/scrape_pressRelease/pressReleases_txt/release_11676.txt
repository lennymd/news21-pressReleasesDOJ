  Richard Hendryx, 79, of Morristown, Ariz., was sentenced today to two years in prison and lifetime supervised release to follow his prison term for travel with intent to engage in sex with minors.  Hendryx was charged on May 6, 2008, with one count of travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor and two counts of distribution of child pornography.

As part of his plea agreement, Hendryx admitted to arranging and paying to be taken to Mexico in order to have sex with two boys aged eight and 10 years.NoneNone   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney James Silver of CEOS, with assistance from Senior Litigation Counsel Vincent Q. Kirby and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon K. Sexton of the District of Arizona. ICE conducted the investigation.
