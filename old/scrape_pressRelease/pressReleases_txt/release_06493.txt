  Dr. Patricia Lynn Hough, of Englewood, Fla., was convicted today by a jury in Fort Myers, Fla., of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by concealing millions of dollars in assets and income in offshore bank accounts at UBS and other foreign banks, and of filing false individual income tax returns which failed to report the existence of those foreign accounts or the income earned in those accounts, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.NoneNone  Dr. Hough's financial transactions were nothing more than a shell game to hide her income, said Richard Weber, Chief, IRS-Criminal Investigation. Her earned income was placed into foreign bank accounts to advance her tax fraud. Taxpayers participating in international tax fraud are under the watchful scrutiny of the IRS, and stopping them is one of our highest priorities."None
