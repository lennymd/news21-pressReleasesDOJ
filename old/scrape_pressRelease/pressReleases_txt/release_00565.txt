Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo to the FBI and ATF directing them to look at several issues as it relates to reporting information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The memo directs the FBI and ATF to take the following steps:The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is critical for us to be able to keep guns out of the hands of those that are prohibited from owning them, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas revealed that relevant information may not be getting reported to the NICS  this is alarming and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am directing the FBI and ATF to do a comprehensive review of the NICS and report back to me the steps we can take to ensure that those who are prohibited from purchasing firearms are prevented from doing so.
