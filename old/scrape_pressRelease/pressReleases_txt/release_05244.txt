Surveillance footage of the attack showed Bellinger and his co-defendant engaged in a verbal exchange with Harris, followed by the two attackers wielding weapons and assaulting Harris, who was unarmed and backing away from them.At the time of the murder, Bellinger was serving a life sentence for an assault with intent to kill that took place in 2000.This case was investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Richard Burns from the Criminal Divisions Capital Case Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Cogar and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brandon Flower of the Northern District of West Virginia.
