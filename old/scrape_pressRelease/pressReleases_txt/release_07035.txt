Heath, a Cartersville, Ga., area tax preparer who operated Heaths Income Tax, Heath & Hames Income Tax and Heaths Income Tax II, from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order, to which Heath agreed without admitting the allegations against him, was signed by Judge Harold L. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The governments complaint in the injunction suit was brought against both Larry Heath and his brother, Andrew R. Heath. The case against Andrew Heath remains pending.NoneThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) previously suspended Larry Heaths IRS-issued electronic filing identification number (EFIN) because of the large number of erroneous returns he prepared, according to the complaint.
