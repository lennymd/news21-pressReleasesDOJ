  WASHINGTON  Genesys Health System has agreed to pay the United States $669,413 to settle a lawsuit alleging that the health care provider violated the False Claims Act by submitting false claims to Medicare, the Justice Department announced today.  Genesys, a Grand Blanc, Mich.-based company, provides health care services through a network of medical facilities located in Michigan. The government alleged that between 2001 and 2007, Genesys violated the False Claims Act by billing Medicare for higher levels of service than were actually rendered to patients. Specifically, the government alleged that Genesys overbilled for evaluation and management services provided to cardiology patients.  "As this case demonstrates, we are committed to vigorously pursuing those who defraud Medicare," said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Civil Division. "Taxpayer dollars should be spent on health care services for patients, not wasted on fraud and abuse." Assistant Attorney General West praised the coordinated efforts of the Justice Departments Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, and the Office of Investigations for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General and Office of Counsel to the Inspector General.None  "With the rising cost of health care and the related pressure on the Medicare Trust Fund, the last thing our nation can afford are providers who are profiteering at the expense of patients," said Terrence Berg, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. "The relator can be proud that she brought these serious allegations of Medicare fraud to our attention and paved the way for the government to uncover the false claims. It is important that anyone who has information about alleged fraud on the federal government come forward so we can investigate."None
