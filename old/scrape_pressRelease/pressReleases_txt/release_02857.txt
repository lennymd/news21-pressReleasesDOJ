A former resident of Portland, Oregon was sentenced to 37 months in prison today for her role in a tax refund fraud scheme, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Justice Departments Tax Division.Tataneisha White, 43, admitted to conspiring with multiple individuals, including Jasmine Mason, Shawntina Ware and Brandon Leath, all of Portland, to file more than 227 false income tax returns claiming more than $1 million in fraudulent refunds. The false information on the tax returns included fictitious W-2 wages and inflated withholding amounts to generate tax refunds ranging from $1,000 to $12,000. White also admitted that she and her co-conspirators shared personal identifying information and employer information with each other to file the false returns.

In October 2015, White pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to file false claims, one count of filing a false claim and one count of theft of government funds.In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Robert E.
