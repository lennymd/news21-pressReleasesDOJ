None       On Sep. 22, 2010, Bradford pleaded guilty to willfully filing a false tax return for 2004. According to court documents, Bradford owned and operated Bradford Builders out of his residence in Ludlow Falls, Ohio.  Bradford Builders built wooden frames for residential construction.        For the 2003 and 2004 tax years, Bradford filed false Forms 1099 that deliberately inflated the amounts that he paid to his independent contractor crew chiefs.  Bradford then used these false amounts from the Forms 1099 to inflate the deductions for labor costs on his 2003 and 2004 individual income tax returns.  Bradford also improperly deducted as business expenses many of the costs incurred in constructing his personal residence.  Bradford also understated his business income by not reporting money he received for work performed for certain clients.
