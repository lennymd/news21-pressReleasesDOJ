      WASHINGTON - Mark D. Leitner has been indicted by a grand jury in the Northern District of Florida for filing false liens against federal law enforcement, corruptly endeavoring to impede and impair the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and public disclosure of anothers Social Security number in the commission of illegal activity, the Justice Department announced today. None       According to the indictment, during the jury trial and after the jury returned the guilty verdict, Leitner caused false maritime liens to be publicly filed against the property of prosecutors, investigators and court personnel involved in the criminal trial. The liens falsely claimed that Leitner was owed $48.489 billion from each individual. On five of the seven false liens, Leitner publicly disclosed individuals correct Social Security numbers; this information was publicly available in each state where the liens were filed. Leitner also filed and mailed numerous harassing and frivolous documents to the court and personnel involved in this case.       An indictment merely alleges that a crime has been committed, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Each count of filing false liens carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  Each count of Social Security fraud carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The corruptly obstructing the IRS charge carries a maximum penalty of up to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.        The case was investigated by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Department of Treasury. None
