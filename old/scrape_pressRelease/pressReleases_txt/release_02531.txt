NoneI am pleased that the Supreme Court has recognized our compelling interest in ensuring diversity in higher education.Diverse student enrollment is a vital part of Americas educational experience. It creates a positive forum for scholarship and discovery, offering the opportunity for young people to learn from, interact with, and work alongside individuals of different backgrounds. It promotes a stronger workforce, allowing employers and businesses to harness the wide range of experience and expertise they need to compete and win in todays global economy. And it aligns with the most cherished values of our country: opportunity, inclusion, and the notion that out of many disparate backgrounds, we are joined together as one united community. Our country is stronger, more credible, and more effective when our educational institutions include highly-qualified individuals with roots, cultures, and traditions that reflect our nations rich diversity. Going forward, the Department of Justice will continue to stand up for these principles, and to work with colleges and universities to promote diversity in a way that is consistent with the law.
