  WASHINGTON - Jonathan Haynes, a former police officer with the Jackson Police Department, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Jackson, Miss., to stealing money from a citizen during an off-duty encounter.  During his plea, Haynes acknowledged that he abused his authority as a law enforcement officer when, on June 21, 2008, while he was off-duty but in uniform, he abused his police powers by stopping and searching two men without legal justification and by stealing $100 from one of the men. Haynes admitted today that his conduct violated the constitutional rights of the two men.  Haynes sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 15, 2009. Haynes faces a maximum penalty of up to one year in prison.  The case was investigated by the FBI. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Erin Aslan of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Glenda Haynes of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi. The defendant is not related to Assistant U.S. Attorney Haynes.
