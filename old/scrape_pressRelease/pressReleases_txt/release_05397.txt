  Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Friday announcing that Stuart Delery, who currently serves as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, will serve as Acting Associate Attorney General, which is the Justice Departments third-ranking post:   Stuart Delery is an exceptional public servant, a dedicated colleague, and a superb lawyer who will continue to ably serve the Department of Justice and the American people in his new role as Acting Associate Attorney General.   Stuart is a lawyers lawyer who, even as he has risen to the leadership of the department, continues to thrive in the court setting and routinely is called on to personally argue the most complex cases. Over the last year, he and his colleagues have led government-wide implementation of the Supreme Courts historic decision in United States v. Windsora case, again, that he personally argued at the appellate levelto ensure that all Americans are afforded the rights, protections, and benefits that they deserve.   Through his outstanding leadership of the Civil Division, Stuart has helped to strengthen our nation's security, to protect public health and safety, and to achieve justice in cases of financial fraud and recover billions of dollars for taxpayers. I can think of no more dedicated, more capable, or more passionate public servant to continue the duties, and uphold the high standards, that defined Tony West's time in office. I am certain that Stuart will help lead us to new heights. I look forward to his continued contributions in the days ahead.
