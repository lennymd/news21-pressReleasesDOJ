  WASHINGTONA federal district judge in Dublin, Ga., has permanently barred James King of McRae, Ga., from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  Court papers allege that King prepared tax returns through his business, "James King Tax Service." The court also ordered King to provide his customer lists, and copies of all tax returns prepared for customers, to the government, and to mail copies of the court order to his customers.  The government complaint alleges that King prepared returns that fabricate or inflate deductions and that he prepared returns that unlawfully claim the Earned Income Tax Credit. According to the complaint, the Internal Revenue Service has examined over 100 returns prepared by King and found that the great majority of those resulted in a tax deficiency. The total deficiencies of the audited returns is alleged to be greater than $400,000. Altogether, the government complaint alleges that James Kings activities may have resulted in the tax loss of tens of millions of dollars.None
