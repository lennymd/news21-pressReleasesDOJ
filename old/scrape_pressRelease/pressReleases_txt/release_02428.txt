Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement today after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Texass voter ID law:I am pleased with todays decision by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit holding that Texass 2011 photographic voter identification law violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. This decision affirms our position that Texass highly restrictive voter ID law abridges the right to vote on account of race or color, and orders appropriate relief before yet another election passes.
