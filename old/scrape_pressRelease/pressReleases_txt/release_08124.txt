      A Newport News, Va., federal grand jury has indicted Jeffrey Charles for conspiring with his daughter and son-in-law to defraud the United States, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. Charles is charged with one count of conspiracy, three counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns and one count of filing a false tax return. The court has not yet set a trial date.      According to the indictment, Charles conspired with his daughter and son-in-law to impair and impede the IRS in ascertaining, computing, assessing and collecting federal income taxes. The indictment also alleges that Charles aided and assisted in the preparation of three false tax returns in his daughters name for tax years 2000, 2001 and 2005, and attached false documents to each tax return. As alleged in the indictment, Charles also filed a false tax return in his own name for tax year 2006 in which he allegedly falsely reported earning $0.00 income.       An indictment merely alleges that a crime has been committed, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Charles faces a maximum of 17 years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $1.25 million.       The case is being investigated by IRS Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Samuels of the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Justin K. Gelfand of the Justice Departments Tax Division.
