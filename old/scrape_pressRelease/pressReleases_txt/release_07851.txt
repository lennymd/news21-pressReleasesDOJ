The Department of Justice, the Congress of Hispanic Educators (CHE) and the Denver Public Schools (DPS) have jointly requested court approval of a consent decree that requires that the more than 20,000 English Language Learner (ELL) students enrolled in DPS receive the services they need to overcome language barriers and meaningfully participate in school. The proposed consent decree will benefit all ELLs and LEP parents in the district, including not only the 87 percent of ELL students who are native Spanish speakers, but those who speak one of the 137 other languages spoken in the district as well. None NoneWe recognize the efforts of the Denver Public Schools to develop and implement a comprehensive and multifaceted plan to serve the thousands of DPS students who are not proficient in English, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Congress of Hispanic Educators and the department have advocated relief to ensure that DPS meets the requirements of federal law, establishes a culture of high expectations and provides a solid foundation for the future success of all students.
