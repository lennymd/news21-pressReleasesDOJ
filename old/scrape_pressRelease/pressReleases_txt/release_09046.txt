None None None      The parallel civil settlement covers a broader range of allegedly illegal conduct by Merck.  The settlement resolves allegations that Merck representatives  made inaccurate, unsupported, or misleading statements about Vioxxs cardiovascular safety in order to increase sales of the drug, resulting in payments by the federal government.  It also resolves allegations that Merck made false statements to state Medicaid agencies about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx, and that those agencies relied on Mercks false claims in making payment decisions about the drug.  Finally, like the criminal plea, the civil settlement also recovers damages for allegedly false claims caused by Mercks unlawful promotion of Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis.       When a pharmaceutical company ignores FDA rules aimed at keeping our medicines safe and effective, that company undermines the ability of health care providers to make the best medical decisions on behalf of their patients, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.  As this plea agreement and civil settlement make clear, we will not hesitate to pursue those who skirt the proper drug approval process and make misleading statements about the safety and efficacy of their products.       Todays resolution appropriately reflects the severity of Mercks conduct; it is yet another reminder that the United States will not tolerate misconduct by drug companies that bends the rules and puts patient safety at risk, announced Carmen M. Ortiz, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Any marketing activity that ignores the importance of FDA approval, or that makes unsupported safety claims about a drug is unacceptable, and will be pursued vigorously in both the criminal and civil arena.        As part of the settlement, Merck has also agreed to enter into an expansive corporate      integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and      Human Services (HHS-OIG), which will strengthen the system of reviews and oversight procedures imposed on the company.  Although Vioxx is no longer on the market, this ongoing monitoring of Mercks conduct is aimed to deter and detect similar conduct in the future.       We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to aggressively investigate and prosecute pharmaceutical companies  no matter how large  when they improperly market their products, said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.Mercks comprehensive corporate integrity agreement requires top company officials to complete annual compliance certifications, and obligates Merck to post information about physician payments on its website.       This case was handled by the Justice Departments Civil Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts.  The investigation was conducted by HHS-OIG, the FBI, the Office of Criminal Investigations for the FDA, the Veterans Administrations Office of Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Inspector General for the Office of Personnel Management, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and the offices of various state attorneys general.
