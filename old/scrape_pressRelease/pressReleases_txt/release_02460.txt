Preparer Who Allegedly Fabricated Business Losses, Claimed Fraudulent Credits and Misreported Self-Employment Income for Customers Ordered to Stop Preparing ReturnsAccording to a lawsuit the United States filed in April, a Birmingham, Alabama, tax return preparer continually and repeatedly prepared federal income tax returns that understated her clients liabilities or overstated their refunds. Now a federal court in Birmingham has permanently barred her from preparing tax returns for others and it has ordered her to give the United States a list of her customers since 2014.Jessica Leverett aka Jessica Harris, owns and operates a number of different tax return preparation businesses in and around Birmingham, including Tax Money Now, Dynamic Tax Services, Dynamic Tax Solutions and Express Money Tax, the civil complaint alleged. Leveretts businesses prepared returns that fabricate Schedule C businesses and business losses to offset their customers taxable income from other sources or to increase the customers Earned Income Tax Credit, according to the complaint. The complaint also alleged that Leveretts businesses prepare returns that claim education credits that Leveretts customers are not entitled to receive and that misreport self-employment income as household employee wages in order to avoid the self-employment tax.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examined 264 returns prepared by Leveretts businesses and found that 206 understated the customers tax due, the complaint alleges. Altogether, Leveretts activities may have caused the United States to lose over $2.5 million in understated taxes and/or fraudulent refunds, according to the complaint. Leverett did not file a response challenging the governments allegations.None
