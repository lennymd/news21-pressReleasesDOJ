  The Department of Justice announced today that it will require Tyson Foods Inc.  to divest Heinold Hog Markets, its sow purchasing business, in order to proceed  with its $8.5 billion acquisition of The Hillshire Brands Company.   The department said that, without the  required divestiture, the transaction would have combined companies that account  for more than a third of sow purchases from U.S. farmers, thereby likely  reducing competition for purchases of sows from farmers.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone None
