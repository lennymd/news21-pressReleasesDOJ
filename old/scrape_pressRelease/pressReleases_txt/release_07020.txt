  Attorney General Eric Holder and Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs Mary Lou Leary announced several improvements to the Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) Program following the completion of a comprehensive review of the program ordered by the Attorney General in May 2012.None  Enacted in 1976, the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act allows the Justice Department to recognize the ultimate sacrifice of law enforcement officers, firefighters and other first responders killed in the line of duty by providing a federal benefit to their eligible survivors. BJAs PSOB Office administers the Death, Disability and Educational Assistance Programs; these benefits assist families who may be struggling with finances in the aftermath of tragedy, as well as officers catastrophically injured in the line of duty and spouses and children seeking educational assistance to attend institutions of higher education. The PSOB Office considers it an honor to assist families and agencies of Americas fallen law enforcement heroes throughout the review of their PSOB cases.  The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary Lou Leary, provides federal leadership in developing the nations capacity to prevent and control crime, administer justice and assist victims. OJP has six components: the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice Statistics; the National Institute of Justice; the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; the Office for Victims of Crime; and the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking.
