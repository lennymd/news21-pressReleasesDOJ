WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced an agreement with Kansas City, Mo., to improve access to all aspects of civic life for people with disabilities. The agreement is the 200th settlement reached under Project Civic Access (PCA), the departments wide-ranging initiative to ensure that cities, towns and counties throughout the country comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).I commend Kansas City officials for their commitment to provide equal access to civic life for all residents and visitors with disabilities in what is the Justice Departments milestone 200th Project Civic Access agreement, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department has positively impacted the lives of more than four and a half million individuals with disabilities through Project Civic Access, and as a result, the injustice of not being able to enter government buildings or participate in government programs, services and activities is becoming a thing of the past for Americans with disabilities.NoneNone
