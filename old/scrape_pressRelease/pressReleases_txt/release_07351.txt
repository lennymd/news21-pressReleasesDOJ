      Fairfax, Va.-based skilled nursing facility Fairfax Nursing Center (FNC) and its owners have agreed to pay $700,000 to resolve allegations that they violated the False Claims Act by knowingly submitting or causing the submission to Medicare of false claims for non-reimbursable rehabilitation therapy services, the Justice Department announced today.       The settlement resolves claims that FNC provided excessive, medically unnecessary, or otherwise non-reimbursable physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to 37 Medicare beneficiaries serviced by FNC between January 2007 and December 2010.  The United States alleged that the rehabilitation therapy services provided by FNC to these beneficiaries were not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of their condition. Specifically, the United States alleged that the therapy services were often excessive, duplicative, performed without clear goals or direction, and, in some instances, performed primarily to capture higher reimbursement rates.         Todays settlement is another example of the Departments efforts to hold skilled nursing facilities accountable for the rehabilitation therapy services they deliver to some of the most vulnerable in our society, said Stuart F. Delery, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.  The provision of excessive and medically unnecessary therapy services will not be tolerated.       Medicare fraud takes many forms and arises in various segments of health care, said U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride. We continue to work toward recovery of money lost to overbillings to Medicare.        This resolution is part of the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and another step for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced by Attorney General Eric Holder and Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in May 2009.   The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation.   One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover nearly $10.2 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.   The Justice Departments total recoveries in False Claims Act cases since January 2009 are over $14 billion. None       The case was handled by the Department of Justices Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Commonwealth of Virginia Attorney Generals Office.  The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.
