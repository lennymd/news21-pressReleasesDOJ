Gleason of the District of Alaska for his March 2015 conviction of attempted sexual exploitation of children and attempted travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place.The evidence presented at trial established that over the course of 12 trips to Cambodia between 2010 and his arrest in 2013, Jayavarman produced multiple videos of himself engaging in sexual acts with an individual who he believed to be a child.
