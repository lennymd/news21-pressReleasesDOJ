NoneMany individuals with disabilities use computers and other electronic devices to access the Internet with the help of assistive technologies, including text-to-speech screen reader software programs, refreshable Braille displays, keyboard navigation and captioning. Such technologies have been readily available and widely used for decades; however, websites must include programming for the assistive technologies to function properly for users with disabilities. Inaccessible websites and mobile applications persist even while there are well-established industry guidelines  the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0  for making web content accessible.NoneNoneNoneretain an independent website accessibility consultant, who will annually evaluate the accessibility of the website and its mobile applications;adopt a formal web accessibility policy;Noneprovide automated accessibility testing and accessibility testing by individuals with a variety of disabilities of www.peapod.com and its mobile applications;provide mandatory annual training on website accessibility for Peapods website content personnel.This agreement ensures that people with disabilities will have an equal opportunity to independently and conveniently shop online for groceries, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.

Title III of the ADA also requires public accommodations to take necessary steps to ensure individuals with disabilities are not excluded, denied services, segregated, or otherwise treated differently because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, such as accessible electronic information. The Justice Department has long considered Title III and its implementing regulation to apply to the online services and communications of public accommodations.None
