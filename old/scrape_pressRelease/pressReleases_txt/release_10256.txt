None       Rozin, 68, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Susan J. Dlott to serve 12 months and one day in prison, a three-year period of supervised release, 2,000 hours of community service, and to pay a $30,000 fine as well as the cost of his prosecution and a special assessment.  Koehler, age 50, was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison, a three-year period of supervised release, and to pay a $20,000 fine and a special assessment. None None       During the three-week trial, the evidence showed that Rozin and Koehler conspired with Liss, Cohen and others to defraud the United States by having Rozin, Inc., dba Buddys Carpet, purchase several sham Loss of Income insurance policies from an insurance company in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The co-conspirators used these sham insurance policies to evade approximately $775,000 in income taxes on the 1998 tax returns of Rozin and Kallick.  In addition, the evidence showed that the co-conspirators intended to evade a similar amount of income taxes for the 1999 tax returns of Rozin and Kallick, but they did not file the returns because the IRS disclosed its criminal investigation.       The evidence showed that, prior to selling the business in 2000, the defendants caused the firm to spend a total of $3.6 million on eight Loss of Income insurance policies, the purpose of which was to provide substantial tax deductions to the company and to the owners, Rozin and Kallick.  The evidence also demonstrated that these insurance policies were a sham.  The evidence further showed that Rozin, Kallick, Koehler, Cohen and Liss attempted to conceal their participation in these sham arrangements by establishing offshore nominee entities in foreign countries, such as Nevis.       The former owners and operators of the source of the Loss of Income policies, Security Trust Insurance Company in the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with their attorney, were also prosecuted and convicted in a federal court in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 2009.        During the trial, the evidence revealed that Rozin and Koehler engaged in a series of purchases of these insurance policies and took numerous steps to conceal their scheme, including creating backdated documents.  In addition, the evidence showed that Rozin, Koehler and others shared Lisss commissions from their purchases of the policies, as well as the commissions from others purchases. None None
