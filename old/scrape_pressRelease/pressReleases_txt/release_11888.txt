  WASHINGTON  A federal judge in San Francisco has issued permanent injunctions barring four individuals from promoting what a government lawsuit describes as a complex tax-fraud scheme involving several entities located around the globe, the Justice Department announced today. U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton signed the injunction orders against Yurij Debevc and Robert Nagy, both of South Carolina; Charles Hsin of New York; and Franklin Thomason of Jilin, China. Debevc, Nagy, Hsin and Thomason agreed to the injunctions without admitting the governments allegations against them.None  The same court barred another defendant, Scott Cathcart, from promoting the 90% loan program last year, after he agreed to a permanent injunction without admitting the governments allegations. The governments request for injunctions against the other defendants, including Charles Cathcart, Scotts father, remains pending with trial scheduled for Nov. 16, 2009.  "Promoter injunctions are a vital part of the Justice Departments efforts to stop complex tax schemes that purport to help wealthy taxpayers eliminate income tax on gains," said John DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division. He thanked Justice Department trial attorneys Nathan Clukey and Ellen Weis, who handled the case, and revenue agents Marie Allen and Judy Steiner of the Internal Revenue Services Small Business/Self-Employed Division, who conducted the investigation.None
