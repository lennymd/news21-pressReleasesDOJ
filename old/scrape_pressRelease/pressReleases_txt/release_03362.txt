Trial before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan began on Nov. 9 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.In the courtroom, facts matter, said Deputy Assistant Attorney General David I. Gelfand of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. Rhetoric does not. This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who buy cooking appliances every year.
