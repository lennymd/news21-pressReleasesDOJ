      Robert C. Sathre was sentenced today to serve 36 months in federal prison for tax evasion by U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced. Sathre was also ordered to pay $3,113,882 in restitution to the IRS and to serve three years of supervised release. Sathre pleaded guilty on Feb. 26, 2014, to willfully evading the payment of his 1995 and 1996 tax liability.     According to court documents and proceedings, Sathre sold a Minnesota business and received installment payments in 1995 and 1996 of more than $3 million. Sathre concealed his income by filing a 1995 tax return in which he reported only $64,928 in total income. Sathre then purchased land and set up another business, a gas station and convenience store in Sheridan, Wyoming, known as the Rock Stop.     According to court documents and proceedings, Sathre concealed assets by opening a foreign bank account in the Caribbean island of Nevis and by using purported trusts. In a 10 month period spanning from 2005 through 2006, Sathre sent over $500,000 to the account in Nevis to keep the funds out of reach from the IRS. When Sathre sold the Rock Stop in 2007, he wired over $1,250,000 from the sale proceeds to the trust account of a Wyoming law firm. He later directed the law firm to wire $900,000 from the trust account to his account at the Bank of Nevis. Sathre also provided a false declaration and false promissory note to the Bank of Nevis to conceal the source of this transfer and obtained a debit card linked to the foreign account to access funds locally. In addition, Sathre provided the Bank of Sheridan with an IRS form on which he falsely claimed that he was neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States.       This case was investigated by special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Ellen Quattrucci and Ignacio Perez de la Cruz of the Justice Departments Tax Division prosecuted the case.
