  The following joint statement was  released Friday by FBI Special Agent in Charge William P. Woods, U.S. Attorney  for the Eastern District of Missouri Richard G. Callahan and Acting Assistant  Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Molly Moran:   At the onset of our federal civil rights investigation, the Attorney General  of the United States promised a thorough and complete investigation into the  shooting death of Michael Brown.  That investigation is proceeding. We can  confirm that FBI agents, working together with attorneys from the Justice  Department's Civil Rights Division and US Attorney's Office, have already  conducted several interviews of witnesses on the scene at the time of the  shooting.  Over the next several days, teams of FBI agents will be canvassing  the neighborhood where the shooting took place to identify any individuals who  may have information related to the shooting and have not yet come forward.  We  ask for the public's cooperation and patience, and again urge anyone with  information related to the shooting to contact the FBI.  The FBI can be reached  at (800) CALL-FBI, option 4.
