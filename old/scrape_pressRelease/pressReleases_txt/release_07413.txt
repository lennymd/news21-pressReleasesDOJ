None According to the indictment, Motley worked for an Alabama state government agency and had access to individuals personal identifying information as part of her job. She stole identities and sold them to several co-conspirators, the indictment alleges. Those co-conspirators used the stolen identities to file false tax returns that fraudulently requested tax refunds from the IRS. An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Motley faces a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison for the conspiracy charge, up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud charge and a mandatory two-year sentence for the aggravated identity theft counts. She will also be subject to fines and mandatory restitution if convicted. This case was investigated by special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Michael Boteler and Jason Poole of the Justice Departments Tax Division are prosecuting the case, with the assistance from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Alabama and, in particular, Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Brown.
