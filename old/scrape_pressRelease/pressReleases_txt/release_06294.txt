      The Justice Department announced today that the United States and a coalition of mental health advocacy organizations have entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement with the state of New Hampshire that will transform New Hampshires mental health system by significantly expanding and enhancing mental health service capacity in integrated community settings.         The settlement agreement will provide people with serious mental illness in New Hampshire with robust community alternatives that will reduce or eliminate the need for hospitalization.  Individuals who receive expanded services in New Hampshire will have fewer visits to emergency rooms and will avoid unnecessary institutionalization at state mental health facilities, including New Hampshire Hospital and the Glencliff Home.         Todays agreement realizes the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act for people with serious mental illness in New Hampshire, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division.  It will better ensure that effective community services will get to the people most in need when and where they need services  in their homes and communities.  These services will help people with mental illness avoid and respond to crises without escalating them and without giving up their important connections to their communities.  This agreement is also a testament to the vision and leadership of Governor Maggie Hassan and Attorney General Joe Foster.       The settlement of this landmark federal civil rights lawsuit marks a major step forward in New Hampshires treatment of one of its most vulnerable populations  those who suffer from mental illness, said U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas for the District of New Hampshire.  I commend the progressive leadership of Governor Hassan and New Hampshire Attorney General Joe Foster and their respective staffs, without whose efforts and will this achievement would not have been possible.       The agreement requires the state to create and expand services over the next six years.  The state will:  create new mobile crisis teams and new community crisis apartments in Manchester, Concord and Nashua; expand and enhance Assertive Community Treatment team services, which will provide state-wide coverage for at least 1,500 people; add hundreds of new supported housing units and work to create community alternatives for people with complex health care needs; and expand effective supported employment services for hundreds of people.  An independent expert reviewer will evaluate the states compliance with the agreement and will issue public reports on the states ongoing implementation efforts.
