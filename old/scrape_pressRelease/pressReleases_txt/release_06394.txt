NoneNoneNone     The case against The Ensign Group involves a company that regularly bilked Medicare by submitting inflated bills that, in some cases, sought money for services that simply were never provided to patients, said U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Andr Birotte Jr. This settlement  one of the largest Medicare fraud cases against a nursing home chain in U.S. history  demonstrates our commitment to protecting taxpayers who fund important programs that benefit millions of Americans, but dont want to see their hard-earned money wasted on fraud or abuse.      In addition to paying the settlement amount, Ensign also agreed that each of its skilled nursing facilities across the nation would be bound by the terms of a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG).NoneNoneNoneNoneNone
