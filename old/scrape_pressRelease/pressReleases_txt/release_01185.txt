North Texas Contractor and Executive Agree to Pay United States $2.475 Million to Resolve False Claims Act and Anti-kickback Act AllegationsMansfield, Texas-based Integrated Medical Solutions Inc. (IMS), along with the companys former President Jerry Heftler, have agreed to pay the United States $2.475 million to settle allegations that they violated the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Act in connection with federal contracts IMS obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the Justice Department announced today.This settlement demonstrates that the Department of Justice is committed to protecting the integrity of the federal contracting process from unscrupulous contractors, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Departments Civil Division. When government contractors maintain improper financial arrangements with government officials, it has a corrupting influence on contracts funded by taxpayer dollars.Our office will continue to aggressively investigate federal contracting abuse and will use all available tools to hold accountable those who try to gain an advantage in contracting through improper means, said U.S. Attorney John R. Parker for the Northern District of Texas.NoneIn October 2014, Hudson pleaded guilty to a felony violation of submitting a false document to an agency of the United States in which he failed to disclose payments he received from IMS as part of his annual obligation as a federal government employee to report any potential conflicts of interests.This matter was handled by the Civil Divisions Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Texas, with assistance from the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General.Except to the extent of the admissions in Hudsons guilty plea, the claims resolved by the civil settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
