    Omnicare Inc., an Ohio-based long-term care pharmacy, has agreed to pay the government $4.19 million to settle allegations that it engaged in a kickback scheme in violation of the False Claims Act, the Justice Department announced today. Omnicare provides pharmaceuticals and services to long-term care facilities and residents and other senior populations.     The settlement resolves allegations that Omnicare solicited and received kickbacks from the drug manufacturer Amgen Inc. in return for implementing therapeutic interchange programs that were designed to switch Medicaid beneficiaries from a competitor drug to Amgens product Aranesp. The government alleged that the kickbacks took the form of performance-based rebates that were tied to market-share or volume thresholds, as well as grants, speaker fees, consulting services, data fees, dinners and travel.      Kickbacks are designed to influence decisions by health care providers, such as which drugs to prescribe, said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division Stuart F. Delery. Americans who rely on federal health care programs, particularly vulnerable patients in skilled nursing facilities, are entitled to feel confident that decisions about their medical care are not tainted by improper financial arrangements.       The District of South Carolina has devoted significant resources over the last three years to pursuing claims under the False Claims Act, and this settlement is the latest example of this offices successful efforts, said U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina William Nettles. I am very proud of the work this office has done in this area. None     Kickbacks corrode our federal health care programs, said Derrick L. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the region covering South Carolina. OIG is committed to unveiling these illegal reciprocal relationships, and companies making or receiving such payments can expect serious consequences.          The settlement with Omnicare Inc. was the result of a coordinated effort among the Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of South Carolina and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. None       The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability. None
