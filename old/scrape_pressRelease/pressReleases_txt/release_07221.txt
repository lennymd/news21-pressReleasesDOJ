  The Justice Departments Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is planning to invest more than$20 million to strengthen the firearm background check system by improving states abilities to share information with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). OJPs Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) are providing funding for three grants to support state, territorial and tribal efforts to reduce information gaps and make instantly available to NICS all records prohibiting the purchase or possession of firearms.   As part of President Obamas comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence, the Administration is committed to enhancing and strengthening the national criminal record system in support of stronger firearm background checks, said Attorney General Eric Holder. The Department of Justice intends to take immediate and effective action to work with states to fill gaps in information currently available to the NICS system.   The NICS background check system is the most efficient and effective way to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals, but in order to work, the system must have timely and accurate information about these individuals. States are a critical source for several key categories of relevant records and data, including criminal history records and records of persons prohibited from having guns because of domestic violence or for mental health reasons. None   Since 1995, the BJS has provided grants and technical assistance to states to improve criminal history data availability for background checks and other purposes under the NCHIP. In 2009, after the Virginia Tech shootings, BJS launched the NARIP, addressing information requirements of NICS firearm background checks and requiring states to make additional records available. BJA also supports information sharing among the nations state and local government agencies, directly supporting the mission of BJS and President Obamas plan to reduce gun violence. None None
