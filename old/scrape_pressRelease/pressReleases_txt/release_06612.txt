The Department of Justices Civil Rights Division has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Prince William County School District in Virginia to improve services for approximately 13,000 students who are English Language Learners (ELLs) and provide language access for Limited English Proficient (LEP) parents district-wide. With the districts cooperation, the department conducted an extensive examination of the ELL programs offered by all 93 schools in the district to determine whether ELL students were receiving adequate services as required by the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA). This examination was prompted by compliance issues identified during the departments earlier EEOA investigation of a complaint regarding the ELL program at a district middle school.The department identified several issues in its review, including inadequate ELL services for ELL students, an insufficient number of properly qualified teachers and administrators, inadequate ELL materials, gaps in the districts communications with LEP parents, insufficient procedures for identifying and serving ELL students with disabilities and ensuring nondiscriminatory discipline of ELL students, an incomplete process for families to opt out of ELL services, and a lack of effective monitoring and evaluation of the district's ELL programs.The agreement requires the district to address these compliance issues identified beginning in the 2013-14 school year and continuing for at least a three-year period. Specifically, the district agrees to:NoneWe applaud the Prince William County school district for working cooperatively with the United States to ensure that all English language learner students have access to the services to which they are entitled, said Jocelyn Samuels, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. We will continue to work cooperatively with the district to monitor its compliance with the agreement.The enforcement of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act is a top priority of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.
