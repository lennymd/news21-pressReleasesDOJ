The United States filed two civil injunction suits seeking to bar three siblings who prepare tax returns and their businesses from owning, operating, or franchising a tax return preparation business and preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The United States filed one complaint against Herve Erilus of Cocoa, Florida, and his business, Herve Erilus LLC. The government filed a second complaint against Gerline Erilus of Orlando, Florida and her two businesses, Gerline Erilus LLC and Elite Multi-Services LLC, and St. Fonie Erilus of Apopka, Florida and her two businesses, St. Fonie Erilus LLC and The Diversified Finance Solutions LLC. The complaints, both filed in United States District Court in Florida, also request that the court require the Eriluses and their businesses to disgorge ill-gotten fees that they obtained from the U.S. Treasury through the alleged false tax return preparation.  According to the complaints, the Eriluses and their tax preparation businesses prepare and file tax returns to falsely increase their customers refunds, and profit through exorbitant, often undisclosed feesat the expense of their customers and the Treasury.  The complaints allege that the Eriluses engage in misconduct, including:   According to the complaints, the Eriluses worked at LBS Tax Services, and their brother, Walner Gachette, through Loan Buy Sell Inc., is the former franchisor of LBS. Since September 2014, the United States has filed 17 lawsuits in Florida and North Carolina including a suit against Gachette and suits against dozens of alleged former LBS franchisees and managers, many of whom, according to the complaints, rebranded and continued to operate tax preparation businesses. Through these lawsuits, the United States has obtained numerous permanent injunctions and money judgments disgorging millions in ill-gotten tax preparation fees.  None
