The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with the city of Yonkers, New York, and the Yonkers Police Department (YPD) to resolve the departments investigation of YPD and ensure constitutional policing.The agreement is the result of the departments investigation of YPD under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. In June 2009, the United States sent the city a technical assistance letter that identified necessary reforms to YPD practices and policies in the areas of use of force, civilian complaints, investigations, supervisory oversight and training. After receiving the departments technical assistance letter, the city and YPD made substantial changes to its policies and procedures. This agreement implements and further improves those policies and procedures and addresses the departments remaining concerns.This agreement will ensure that the Yonkers Police Department continues to advance constitutional, effective and community-oriented policing, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.
