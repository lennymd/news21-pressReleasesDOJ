Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Louis V. Franklin, Sr. for the Middle District of Alabama. According to the indictment, from February 2007 through May 2014, Alita Baker Edeker of Valley, Alabama stole over $500,000 of her employers funds for her own personal benefit and the benefit of others, by directing customer payments to debit and credit cards she controlled. The indictment further alleges that Edeker made false statements and representations in the companys books and records in order to conceal her misappropriation. After misappropriating the funds, the indictment further alleges that Edeker willfully filed false U.S. individual income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013 that did not report the money.
