Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on todays attack in Mali:The Department of Justice stands with our international partners in condemning the appalling attack in Mali. This was a shameful assault on innocent people by terrorists intent on sowing panic and fear. But I want to make clear to our enemies: fear will not take hold, nor will terror dictate our course, or that of our allies. Instead, a tragedy like todays reinforces our commitment to the values that separate us from the attackers, and serves to cement the ideals that make us who we are: freedom, opportunity, and justice.I understand that the State Department has now confirmed one American death in the attacks and I would like to send my condolences to the family and friends during this difficult time.In the days ahead, the Department of Justice and the Obama Administration will continue to coordinate with our allies around the world to bring terrorists to justice and to assist victims of terror in any way possible. We will continue our work to protect the American people. And we will continue to stand with all Americans in upholding the values that our nation represents.
