  Paul Tillis, a former Florida Department of Corrections officer, was sentenced today in federal court in Jacksonville, Fla., on a federal civil rights charge related to assaulting an inmate. Tillis was sentenced to three years in prison followed by two years of post-release supervision.  Following a week-long trial, a federal jury in Jacksonville convicted Tillis on Jan. 16, 2009, of violating the civil rights of an inmate at the Florida State Prison in Raiford while on duty as a supervisory corrections officer. The evidence at trial showed that he assaulted the victim by pouring a bottle of scalding water onto the inmates chest while the inmate was lying on the floor of his cell. The evidence showed that Tillis also failed to arrange for medical care for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.  "Corrections officers must not misuse their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. "While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit acts of cruelty such as this."  This case was investigated by agents from the FBIs Jacksonville Division and the Florida Office of the Inspector General. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mac Heavener of the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Douglas Kern.None
