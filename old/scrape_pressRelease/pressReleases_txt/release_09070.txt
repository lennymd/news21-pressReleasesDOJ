      WASHINGTON    Charges of copyright infringement were   unsealed today in federal court in Philadelphia against a Pennsylvania man for allegedly infringing on copyright protected broadcasts of hockey games, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.         The seven-count indictment alleges that Michael Moore, 44, of Chadds Ford, Penn., infringed the copyright protected works during seven six-month periods between May 2006 and June 2010.         The indictment alleges that HDHOCKEY.TV was a website that offered for sale DVDs containing recordings of copyrighted television broadcasts of hockey games and other copyrighted works such as team and player profiles, from the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional hockey leagues.  It also alleges that BROADSTREETBULLY.COM was a website offering for sale monthly subscriptions that enabled subscribers to download an unlimited number of video clips of copyrighted television broadcasts of hockey games, and other copyrighted works such as team and player profiles, from the NHL and other professional hockey leagues.  The indictment alleges that neither site had the permission of the NHL or any other professional hockey league to reproduce or distribute these recordings.         Charges contained in an indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.       The maximum penalty for each count of copyright infringement is five years in prison.  The indictment also seeks forfeiture.         The case was investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Albert S. Glenn for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Trial Attorney Evan Williams of the Criminal Divisions Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.
