WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Prisons today implemented a key provision of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 by launching a four-year pilot program to begin accepting certain tribal offenders sentenced in tribal courts for placement in Bureau of Prisons institutions.The pilot program allows any federally recognized tribe to request that the bureau incarcerate a tribe member convicted of a violent crime under the terms of Section 234 of the Tribal Law and Order Act and authorizes the bureau to house up to 100 tribal offenders at a time, nation-wide. By statute, the pilot will conclude on Nov. 26, 2014.None A fundamental goal of the Bureau of Prisons is to reduce future criminal activity by encouraging inmates to participate in a range of programs that have been proven to help them adopt a crime-free lifestyle upon their return to the community. Accordingly, the bureau provides many self-improvement programs, including work in prison industries and other institution jobs, vocational training, education, substance abuse treatment, parenting, anger management, counseling, religious observance opportunities and other programs that teach essential life skills.
