None     This Administration is committed to using science to help inform and guide policy development. By providing advice and counsel to the Department of Justice, the members of this advisory board will help us focus on evidence-based approaches to prevent and reduce crime, said Attorney General Holder.    In FY 2010, OJP, which administers grants on behalf of the department, awarded nearly 5,000 grants totaling $2.6 billion to the criminal and juvenile justice field, including federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies, and community organizations. The funding supports a wide range of activities, including research and evaluation programs designed to encourage innovative programs to prevent and control crime, assist victims, and increase the capacity of state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies.      I look forward to working with this advisory board to ensure that OJPs research is scientifically rigorous and that it is translated effectively for policymakers and practitioners in the criminal and juvenile justice fields, said Assistant Attorney General Robinson.      The advisory board will provide an extra-agency review of and recommendations for OJP research, statistics and grant programs, ensuring the programs and activities are scientifically sound and pertinent to policymakers and practitioners.
