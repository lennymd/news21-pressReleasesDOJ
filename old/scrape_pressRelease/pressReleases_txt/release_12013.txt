  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department today announced an agreement with the former owners and managers of Valley View Apartments in Longview, Wash., to settle allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act by intentionally discriminating against an individual with a disability. Under the settlement, which must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the defendants must pay a total of $35,000 to the complainant.  The lawsuit originated from charges filed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on behalf of a tenant of Valley View Apartments. In 2004, the tenant, who has a mobility impairment that limits his ability to enter or exit a car, asked to use two contiguous parking spaces in the apartment complexs lot until a handicap accessible space became available. The complaint alleged that the former owners and managers of the apartments, John E. and Shirley L. Price, violated the Fair Housing Act when they intentionally discriminated against the tenant by refusing his request and by initiating retaliatory eviction proceedings. The complaint also alleged that the tenants request was reasonable and necessary to afford him an equal opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling.  "Individuals with disabilities have the basic right to expect reasonable accommodations that allow them access to housing. This settlement is a significant award for a case involving housing discrimination against a lone individual, and it should send a strong message to landlords that they must take all requests for reasonable accommodations very seriously," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King of the Civil Rights Division.NoneNone
