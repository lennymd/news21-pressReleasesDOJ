  WASHINGTON  Charges were unsealed this morning against a Pennsylvania man, alleging that he hacked into computer networks in Massachusetts and around the country and then sold unauthorized access to those networks.  The charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz of the District of Massachusetts and Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers of the FBI in Boston.  Andrew James Miller, 23, of Devon, Penn., was arrested this morning on charges contained in a four-count indictment filed in the District of Massachusetts. He is charged with one count of conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud and one count of access device fraud.  According to the indictment, between 2008 and 2011, Miller and others allegedly remotely hacked into computer networks belonging to RNK Telecommunications Inc., a Massachusetts company; Crispin Porter and Bogusky Inc., a Colorado advertising agency; the University of Massachusetts; the U.S. Department of Energy; and other institutions and companies. The indictment alleges that when Miller hacked into the computers, he obtained other users access credentials to the compromised computers. He and his co-conspirators then allegedly sold access to these computer networks as well as other access credentials.None
