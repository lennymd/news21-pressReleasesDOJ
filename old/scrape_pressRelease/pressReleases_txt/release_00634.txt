A Chicago, Illinois, woman was sentenced to 30 months in prison today for conspiring to file fraudulent tax returns using stolen identities, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division, and Acting U.S. Attorney Joel R. Levin of the Northern District of Illinois.  According to documents filed with the court, from 2012 to 2015 Dominique King, 27, conspired with Roxann Gist, 45, and another co-conspirator to file at least 858 fraudulent income tax returns, using stolen names and social security numbers. Those fraudulent returns sought more than $2.7 million in refunds. As part of the scheme, Gist and King acquired the personal identification information of thousands of unsuspecting individuals and directed others to receive and collect fraudulent income tax refund checks and to open up bank accounts to access direct deposits of such refunds.  In addition to the term of imprisonment imposed, King was ordered to serve two years of supervised release and to pay $1,332,935 in restitution to the IRS. King also pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to steal public money and aggravated identity theft. In September Gist was sentenced to 36 months in prison. She previously pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to steal public money, theft of public money, and aggravated identity theft.  Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg commended the Special Agents of IRS Criminal Investigation who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorney Timothy M. Russo of the Tax Division, who prosecuted this case. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg also thanked the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois for their substantial assistance in the case. None
