  WASHINGTON    A federal court has barred Robert Knupp of Marietta, Ga., from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The preliminary injunction order, signed by Chief Judge Julie E. Carnes of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, found that Knupp promotes a tax defier scheme that claims large fraudulent tax refunds for customers. The order remains in effect indefinitely, while the Justice Department lawsuit against Knupp is pending. Violation of a preliminary injunction can result in civil and criminal sanctions, including fines and imprisonment.  The court found that Knupp repeatedly prepared federal income tax returns claiming "huge and fraudulent" refunds for customers, "in amounts sometimes in the millions of dollars," based on a tax-fraud scheme known as the "redemption" or "OID redemption" scheme. The court further found that Knupp prepared and filed 58 income tax returns for customers in 2009 claiming more than $11 million in fraudulent refunds. The court said that the redemption scheme is based on a frivolous theory that the federal government maintains secret accounts for its citizens, and that taxpayers can gain access to funds in those accounts by issuing IRS 1099-OID forms to their creditors.NoneNone
