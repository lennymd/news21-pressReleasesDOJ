NoneNone  We owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard along with EPA-CID and Louisiana DEQ for their continued vigilance in protecting our precious environment and water resources from companies and individuals who discharge oily waste into our waters, said Jim Letten, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. We will remain committed to the apprehension and punishment of these violators in defense of our environment. The protection of our precious environment is a critical mission which we take very seriously. Simply stated, we will not tolerate the negligent contamination of our waterways.  Its important that we hold polluters accountable for their actions, and today's sentence does this, said Captain Peter Gautier, Commander of Coast Guard Sector New Orleans. I applaud the efforts of our partner agencies and internal investigators for their tireless efforts in prosecuting this case. The Coast Guard, EPA, LDEQ and Department of Justice will continue to hold polluters responsible for their actions.NoneNoneNone
