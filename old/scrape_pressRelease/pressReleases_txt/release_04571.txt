NoneFor too long, the Supreme Courts promise of fairness for young people accused of delinquency has gone unfulfilled in courts across our country, said Attorney General Eric Holder. Every child has the right to a competent attorney who will provide the highest level of professional guidance and advocacy. It is time for courts to adequately fund indigent defense systems for children and meet their constitutional responsibilities.Every day, in communities across our country, under-resourced public defense systems fail to meet their constitutional obligation to provide effective representation for children, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division. Children who depend on these failing systems often get the poorest representation, relegating them to second-class status in our courts. The systemic deprivation of counsel for children cannot be tolerated.NoneIn its statement of interest, the department asserts that children are denied their right to counsel not only when an attorney is entirely absent, but also when an attorney is available in name only. It provides the court with a framework to assess the plaintiffs claim that the defendants are depriving young people accused of delinquency of their right to counsel. As the department summarized in the statement of interest, due process requires that every child who faces the loss of liberty should be represented from their first appearance through, at least, the disposition of their case by an attorney with the training, resources and time to effectively advocate the childs interest. If a child decides to waive the right to an attorney, courts must ensure that the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary by requiring consultation with counsel before the court accepts the waiver.None
