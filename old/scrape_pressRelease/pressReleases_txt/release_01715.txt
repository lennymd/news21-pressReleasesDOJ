None None The settlement resolves allegations that from Jan. 1, 2011, through Oct. 31, 2014, Medstar submitted false claims to Medicare for ambulance transport services. Specifically, the United States alleged that Medstar routinely billed for services that did not qualify for reimbursement because the transports were not medically reasonable and necessary, billed for higher levels of services than were required by patients conditions, and billed for higher levels of services than were actually provided.  None None Ambulance service companies should be focused on the needs of the patients, said HHS Office of Inspector General Special Agent in Charge Phillip Coyne. Billing Medicare for ambulance rides that were unnecessary or at a higher rate than could be medically justified is unacceptable. Together with our law enforcement partners, we will seek out and stop this fraudulent behavior. None None None The case is captioned United States ex rel. Meehan v. Medstar Ambulance. Inc., et al., No. 13-CV-12495-IT (D. Mass). The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.
