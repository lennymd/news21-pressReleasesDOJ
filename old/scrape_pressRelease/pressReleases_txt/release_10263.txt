Per instructions from the owners and operators of Ritecare, Young admitted that he instructed the patients to claim they had certain symptoms to trigger medically unnecessary tests.   Consequently, the patients medical records contained false symptoms allowing Ritecare to deceive Medicare as to the legitimacy and medical necessity of the tests it performed.       Young admitted that King and he were responsible for recruiting at least 269 patients to Ritecare.   Through his recruitment efforts, Young caused the submission of approximately $940,760 in false or fraudulent billings by Ritecare.   Medicare paid approximately $533,643 on those claims.
