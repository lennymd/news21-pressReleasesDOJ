      WASHINGTON    A Pittsburgh man was sentenced today to 10 years in prison for conspiring to conduct a racketeering enterprise related to his membership in a Pittsburgh Crips gang, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania.       Rayshawn Malachi, 26, aka Melly Mel, pleaded guilty on April 28, 2011, before Senior U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond to one count of conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise.        According to the guilty plea, Malachi and others participated in a pattern of racketeering activity that included multiple acts involving robberies at gun point; attempted murders; distribution of controlled substances, including cocaine, heroin and crack cocaine; and obstruction of justice and witness intimidation.       According to court documents, Malachi was a member of the Northview Heights/ Fineview Crips, a criminal street gang that operated in the Northview Heights public housing venue on the North Side of Pittsburgh.  The Northview Heights Crips gang was formed around 2001-2002.  In 2003, it formed an alliance with the Brighton Place Crips.  The alliance expanded the gangs drug trafficking territory, and increased the number of gang members and associates available to preserve and protect the gangs power, territory and profits through violence.         The Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips gang maintains exclusive control over drug trafficking in these neighborhoods through continuous violence and intimidation of rivals and witnesses. Members of the gang support each other through payment of attorneys fees and bonds, as well as payments to jail commissary accounts and support payments to incarcerated members families.         In addition, gang members have violent confrontations with members of the rival Manchester OGs and other street gangs operating in the Northside area of Pittsburgh. Members and associates obtained greater authority and prestige within the enterprise based on their reputation for violence and their ability to obtain and sell a steady supply of illegal drugs. According to court documents, the Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips gang members identify themselves by wearing blue, flashing Crips gang hand signals, and using phrases such as Cuz, C-Safe, Loc and G.K.          According to court documents, Malachi was considered a hustler for the enterprise, which meant he distributed controlled substances, including heroin and crack cocaine.         Malachi is one of 26 defendants charged in February 2010 with being members or associates of the Brighton Place/Northview Heights Crips gang. This prosecution resulted from a Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Force investigation that began in 2005.  There are no further pending charges against the 26 individuals originally indicted in the case. None
