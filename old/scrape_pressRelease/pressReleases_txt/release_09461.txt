  WASHINGTON  A Michigan woman was sentenced today to two years in prison for selling more than $400,000 worth of counterfeit computer software, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade for the Eastern District of Michigan.   Jacinda Jones, 31, of Ypsilanti, Mich., also was ordered by U.S. District Court Judge David M. Lawson in Detroit to serve three years of supervised release following her prison term and to pay $441,035 in restitution.   Jones pleaded guilty on April 20, 2011, to one count of criminal copyright infringement.   According to documents filed in court, Jones grossed more than $400,000 between July 2008 and January 2010 by selling more than 7,000 copies of pirated business software at discounted prices through the website www.cheapdl.com.   The software had a retail value of more than $2 million and was owned by several companies, including Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit and Symantec .   Jones activities came to the attention of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who made several undercover purchases of the pirated business and utility software.NoneNone None
