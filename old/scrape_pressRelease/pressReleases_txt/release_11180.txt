  WASHINGTON  Christine Varney, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division, will participate in the ninth annual International Competition Network (ICN) conference in Istanbul, Turkey, from April 27-29, 2010. At the conference, senior government antitrust officials, private-sector antitrust experts and representatives of intergovernmental organizations will meet to discuss competition issues.  The ICN conference will focus on the recent accomplishments of its five main working groups, which address: unilateral conduct, mergers, cartels, competition advocacy and agency effectiveness. Conference panels will discuss the role of outside parties in merger review, the analysis of price squeezes, trends in anti-cartel enforcement and the interaction of competition policy with other policies. Members will also approve working group programs for the coming year.  In October 2001, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) joined with antitrust agencies from 13 other jurisdictions around the world (Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Zambia) to create the ICN. The ICN now includes 112 member agencies from 99 jurisdictions. The goal of the ICN is to provide a forum for antitrust agencies to address enforcement and policy issues of common interest, and to propose ways that member governments could more closely align their policies and enforcement.
