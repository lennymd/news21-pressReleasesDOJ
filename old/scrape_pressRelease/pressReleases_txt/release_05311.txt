The United States has asked a federal court in Philadelphia to permanently bar Denise Miller Almanza and her business, Denises Centro de Servicios, PC, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. According to the complaint, Almanza inappropriately reduces her customers income or wrongly claims tax credits on their returns, causing the customers to receive tax refunds or increased refund amounts to which they are not entitled. Almanza and her business have prepared more than 14,000 federal tax returns since 2010, according to the complaint.The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that Almanza improperly claims the additional child tax credit on customers income tax returns, which allow her customers to receive, on average, over $2,900 in improper benefits per tax return. In total, the complaint alleges that Almanzas activities over the last four years have potentially cost the U.S. Treasury millions of dollars in lost tax revenue.NoneRelated Materials:None
