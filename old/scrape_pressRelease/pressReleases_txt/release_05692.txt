  WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released the following  statement Friday on the passing of actress Ruby Dee:  I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Ruby Dee  a legendary  actress and a lifelong champion for civil rights and social justice.  Rising from humble origins to the heights of stardom, Ruby Dee broke down  barriers and left her mark from Harlem, to Broadway, to Hollywood and far  beyond.  She was also an extraordinary role model for generations of Americans   and particularly for African-American women and girls  during a time when black  stars were rare on both stage and screen.  Tellingly, she was never content merely to advance her own remarkable  career, lending her voice and her considerable fame to causes from the American  Civil Rights Movement to the global campaign against Apartheid.  She stood with  Dr. King and other leaders at the 1963 March on Washington, and later spoke at  his funeral.  She won extensive recognition for her achievements on stage, on  the radio, in film, and on television.  And she never slowed down or let up,  delivering powerful performances and speaking out against injustice  often  alongside her late husband, the great Ossie Davis  over the course of a career  spanning more than six decades.  I will always remember Ruby Dee was a wonderful entertainer, a truly great  actress, a fierce activist, and an indispensable leader in the fight for civil  rights.  She left an indelible impression on me when, as a young man, I saw her  unforgettable performance in A Raisin in the Sun. Today, I join millions of  Americans in expressing my heartfelt condolences, and deepest sympathies, to her  family and friends.  Her work, her example, and her memory will endure.  But she  will be dearly missed.
