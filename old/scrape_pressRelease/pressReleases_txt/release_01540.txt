The U.S. Department of Justice today filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the owners and manager of three Edmonds, Washington apartment buildings refused to rent their apartments to families with children, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.  The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination. None None The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, and civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96. None The case is being jointly handled by the Departments Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Washington. The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegations must still be proven in federal court.
