NoneGlenn Guillory was charged on Dec. 3, 2014, in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of California. Guillory was convicted on April 17, 2017, of conspiring to rig bids at real estate foreclosure auctions in Contra Costa County. Today, Guillory was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison and to serve three years of supervised release. In addition to his term of imprisonment, Guillory was ordered to pay a criminal fine of $20,000.Between June 2008 and January 2011, Guillory conspired with others not to bid against one another for selected properties, instead designating a winning bidder to win the property at the auction. The members of the conspiracy then held second, private auctions to award the properties to members of the conspiracy and determine payoffs for those who had agreed not to bid against one another at the public auctions. The private auctions often took place at or near the courthouse steps where the public auctions were held.The sentence is a result of an ongoing investigation into bid rigging at public real estate foreclosure auctions in Californias San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties. These investigations are being conducted by the Antitrust Divisions San Francisco Office and the FBIs San Francisco Office.None
