      A federal grand jury in Nashville, Tenn., has indicted 26 members and associates of the violent gang known as the Bloods, for various charges, including conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise, conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering, assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering, assault resulting in serious bodily injury in aid of racketeering, conspiracy to use and carry firearms during and in relation to crimes of violence, and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, cocaine, hydromorphone and marijuana.  The indictment was announced today by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Jerry E. Martin and Deputy Director Kenneth Melson of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  The indictment was returned under seal last week and unsealed Wednesday upon the arrests of the defendants.       The Department of Justice is committed to protecting our nations communities from the violent and dangerous crimes alleged in this indictment, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  We will continue to use all resources and tools at our disposal to disrupt and dismantle gangs wherever they exist and we will be aggressive in bringing to justice the members of these violent organizations.        We believe the individuals named in the indictment have been responsible for multiple attempted murder conspiracies and numerous violent crimes in the Nashville area, stated U.S. Attorney Martin.  We have also alleged that many of these individuals were involved in substantial narcotics distribution.  These arrests are merely the next logical step in the on-going investigation.  I am confident that as we continue to unpackage and piece together the illegal activity of these individuals, our community will be a safer place as we prepare to present our cases against these individuals and insure they are removed from our community for a long period of time.       The message today is clear for violent criminals: you have nowhere to hide, said ATF Deputy Director Kenneth Melson.The gang members arrested during this operation have allegedly victimized families in the Nashville area for too long.  This round up will give grandparents, parents and their children piece of mind and a safer place to call home, as we send a message to criminals that ATF will not tolerate acts of violence in our communities.        This indictment is the result of the hard work of our law enforcement community, particularlymembers of ourGang Unit who discovered that several seized firearms were involved in a number of shootings that were ultimately linked to the Bloods gang, Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said. The indictment accuses these individuals of very violent crimes that are most deserving of the full attention of our police department, the ATF, the U.S. Attorneys Office and the District Attorneys office.
