A federal district judge in Miami permanently barred Marlen Monzon, her son Yanko Rodriguez, and their Miami business, Tri Stars Multiservices Corporation, from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.According to the governments complaint, Monzon and Rodriguez prepared federal income tax returns in Miami through Tri Stars Multiservices, Corporation. As alleged, the returns prepared by Monzon and Rodriguez included fabricated claims for business expenses on customers returns even when the customers did not own or operate a business. The complaint further alleged that these fabricated expenses offset the customers wage income and improperly lowered the customers reported taxable income. These fabricated expenses generated (or increased) customers refunds, and often qualified customers for credits to which they were not entitled. The complaint alleged that nearly every one of the 498 returns that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examined for tax years 2008 through 2011 claimed that the customer operated a business and reported a business loss. According to the complaint, the IRS has determined that the U.S. Treasury lost more than $3.4 million in revenue as a result of Monzon and Rodriguezs misconduct.Monzon, Rodriguez and Tri Stars consented to the entry of the injunction.NoneRelated Materials:None
