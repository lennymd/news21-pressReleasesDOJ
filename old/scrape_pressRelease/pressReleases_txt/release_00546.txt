A former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) Special Agent pleaded guilty today to accepting bribes in exchange for securing the dismissal of a drug trafficking indictment filed against a Colombian cocaine trafficker, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departments Criminal Division. None Ciccione admitted that in furtherance of this scheme to obstruct justice, he misled the U.S. Attorneys Office and HSI management and altered law enforcement records to represent to decision makers that Piedrahita was a former suspect of a closed investigation, rather than a current subject, who was never positively identified and that his case should be dismissed all while maintaining contact with Piedrahita. Ciccone also falsified the concurrence of several other federal agents and attempted to parole Piedrahita into the United States. NoneCiccione will be sentenced on Feb. 9, 2018, before U.S. District Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the Southern District of Florida. Piedrahita is currently incarcerated in the Republic of Colombia.  The U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Piedrahita as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act on May 3, 2016. NoneICEs Office of Professional Responsibility, Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General and the FBI investigated the case. The Criminal Divisions Office of International Affairs, the Office of the Judicial Attach in Colombia and the Drug Enforcement Administration provided valuable assistance to the investigation.
