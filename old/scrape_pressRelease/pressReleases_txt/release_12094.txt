  Everett Cooney waived indictment and pleaded guilty in court in Little Rock, Ark., to a federal charge of sex trafficking an underage female. Chief U.S. District Judge J. Leon Holmes accepted Cooneys guilty plea.  During the hearing, Cooney admitted that he knew the underage female with the initials of "DB" was between the ages of 14 and 18 when he caused her to engage in the commercial sex acts, from which he benefitted. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the pending indictment was dismissed upon the courts acceptance of Cooneys plea to the sex trafficking charge. Cooney faces a minimum of 10 years and up to life in prison. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled by the court. Cooney remains in custody pending his sentencing.  Cooneys co-defendant, Tommy Handy, is also in custody awaiting trail. The trial is scheduled for Oct. 5, 2009.
