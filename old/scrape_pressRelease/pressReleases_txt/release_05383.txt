The Justice Department today filed a lawsuit against the Kent State University, the Kent State University Board of Trustees and university officials for violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against students with disabilities in student housing. None The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers, including universities operating student housing, to grant reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities to ensure equal housing opportunities, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Molly Moran for the Civil Rights Division. Housing providers may not discriminate against individuals based on the type of disability they have. The Justice Department is committed to enforcing fair housing laws that protect the rights of all people, including individuals with psychological or emotional disabilities, to obtain reasonable accommodations when they are needed. Many people with disabilities rely on therapy animals to enhance their quality of life, said HUD Assistant Secretary Gustavo Velasquez for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. HUD and the Department of Justice will continue to work together to take action whenever the nations fair housing laws are violated. The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting future discrimination by the defendants, monetary damages for those harmed by the defendants actions and a civil penalty. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are urged to contact the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section of the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, extension 992. None The complaint is an allegation of unlawful conduct. The allegation must still be proven in federal court.U.S. v. Kent State
