  Kathryn Keneally, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Tax Division, and Kerry B. Harvey, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky, jointly announced today that James S. Faller II, of Russell Springs, Ky., was indicted by a federal grand jury in Bowling Green, Ky. Faller, a consultant and private investigator, is charged in an eleven count indictment with obstructing the internal revenue laws, evading his individual income taxes, making and subscribing to a false form that he filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and failing to file his individual income tax returns.  The indictment alleges that Faller obstructed the IRSs ability to collect payment of a substantial penalty he owed to the government and the IRSs ability to identify his income from 2006 through 2009. According to the indictment, Faller evaded the payment of a $216,000 penalty related to unpaid employment taxes of Call Center Communications Inc., of which Faller was the president. In addition, Faller was charged with evading his individual income taxes from 2006 through 2009. He allegedly failed to report more than $960,000 of income during this four-year period and committed various affirmative acts of evasion. NoneNone
