  Today, the Department of Justice issued a letter of findings describing problems in the Missoula County, Mont., Attorneys Offices response to sexual assault, and concluding that there is substantial evidence that the County Attorneys response to sexual assault discriminates against women. The department opened civil pattern or practice investigations of the Missoula County Attorneys Office, along with the Missoula Police Department and the University of Montanas Office of Public Safety, in May 2012. The department investigations, brought under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, and the anti-discrimination provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, focused on allegations that the three law enforcement agencies were systematically failing to protect women victims of sexual assault in Missoula. The department, along with the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education, also opened an investigation of the University of Montanas handling of allegations of sexual assault and harassment of students under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The investigation of the Missoula Police Department and both investigations of the University of Montana were resolved in May 2013, via cooperative agreements with the Justice Department.   Prosecutors play a critical role in ensuring that women victims of sexual assault have effective and equal access to criminal justice, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Civil Rights Division. We uncovered evidence of a disturbing pattern of deficiencies in the handling of these cases by the County Attorneys Office, a pattern that not only denies victims meaningful access to justice, but places the safety of all women in Missoula at risk.We hope that this letter will enable us to move forward with constructive discussions with the County Attorney to resolve these serious concerns. NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone   Over the past eight months, the City of Missoula, the University of Montana and the Missoula Police Department already have made important strides toward improving their response to sexual assault and strengthening the communitys confidence in its local police, said U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter for the District of Montana. It is our sincere hope that the Missoula County Attorney will follow that example and work cooperatively with the Justice Department to address the deficiencies identified in our investigation, and to improve the safety of women in this community.None
