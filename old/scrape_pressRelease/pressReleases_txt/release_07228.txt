The United States has asked a federal court in Montgomery, Ala., to bar Kenya Hendrix Adams from preparing tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. According to the government complaint, Adams has repeatedly prepared federal tax returns that understate her clients federal tax liabilities. The suit alleges that Adams did so by falsely claiming or inflating tax credits or fabricating deductions.The suit alleges that the IRS has completed examinations of 315 returns prepared by Adams and that 88 percent of those returns understated the filing taxpayers liability. Because Adams prepared almost 2,000 returns over a five year period between 2007 and 2012, the suit alleges that the harm to the U.S. Treasury as a result of her conduct could be in the millions of dollars.NoneRelated Materials:None
