Trial evidence showed that the clinics owners purchased only a small fraction of the medications for which the clinic billed the Medicare program. According to evidence presented at trial, medications at the clinic were prescribed based not on medical need, but based on what medications were likely to generate Medicare reimbursements. Denisse Martinez, despite having no medical training, completed the clinics patient records by filling in, among other things, the "diagnosis" and "treatment" sections of the patient charts, which were then provided to Silber for his signature. Evidence presented at trial showed that Silber signed the diagnosis and treatment forms even though he neither made the diagnosis nor made any independent medical judgment as to the course of treatment. Expert testimony established that there was no legitimate medical basis for the use of the medications that Silber approved at the clinic, and, that in several instances, the medications could have harmed the patients. Evidence at trial established that Silber routinely approved the use of medications for patients despite knowing that the medications were unnecessary.None   Between approximately December 2006 and March 2007, Silber, Reeves and their co-conspirators caused the submission of approximately $970,631 in false and fraudulent claims to be submitted to the Medicare program for services supposedly provided by RDM Center.
