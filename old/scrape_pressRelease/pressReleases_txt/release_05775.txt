Today a federal grand jury in Milwaukee returned a two count indictment charging Paul Carter, aka Pimpin Paul, with sex trafficking offenses dating from 2012 through 2013, the Justice Department announced. Carter, 44, of Milwaukee, is charged with one count of sex trafficking of an adult female by force, threats of force, fraud and coercion. Carter is also charged with one count of sex trafficking of a minor. Carter allegedly used force, threats of force, fraud and coercion to cause the victim to engage in a commercial sex act while knowing that the victim was under the age of 18. If convicted, Carter faces a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison on each charge.  The case was investigated by the Human Trafficking Task Force for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, which includes law enforcement officers from the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation and the Milwaukee Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Karine Moreno-Taxman of the Eastern District of Wisconsin and Trial Attorney Daniel H. Weiss of the Civil Rights Division's Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
