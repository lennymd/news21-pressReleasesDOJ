    A federal grand jury in Albuquerque, N.M., has indicted Gordon Chavez, 35, a probation officer with the New Mexico Corrections Department on charges related to the sexual assault of a probationer whom he supervised. The New Mexico Corrections Department placed Chavez on administrative leave following his arrest on Dec. 4, 2012.    Chavez was charged with violating the civil rights of the victim by engaging in unwanted sexual contact.  The indictment also charges Chavez with making material false statements to the FBI.  Specifically, the latter count charges Chavez with lying to the FBI when he denied touching the breasts of any female under his supervision and when he denied asking females under his supervision for naked photographs.  The indictment alleges that Chavez knew these statements were false at the time that he made them because he had, in fact, engaged in these behaviors.        This investigation is ongoing. Anyone with additional information is encouraged to call the Albuquerque Division of the FBI at (505) 889-1300.None    This case is being investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Baker for the District of New Mexico and Fara Gold of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
