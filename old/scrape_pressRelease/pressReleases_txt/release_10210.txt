None        Through this action, the United States and Ohio will secure reductions of harmful emissions by requiring that CEMEX adopt state of the art technology and take immediate steps to control pollutants, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice.   As in the case of other Portland cement plants that have agreed to come into compliance with the Clean Air Act, the CEMEX plant has been a major source of air pollution, and this settlement will result in a healthier environment for residents of Fairborn, Ohio, and the surrounding region.   Emissions of harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can lead to a number of serious health and environmental problems, including premature death and heart disease, said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.   Todays settlement will help keep harmful air pollution out of Ohio communities, protect children with asthma and prevent region-wide public health problems.        The settlement, which is subject to court approval, addresses CEMEX modifications to its cement plant which were made without obtaining a permit as required by the Clean Air Act.   Major sources of air pollution are required to obtain such permits before making changes that would result in a significant emissions increase of any pollutant.   Todays settlement ensures that the proper equipment will be installed to reduce future emission levels. None None   CEMEX, a global building materials company provides cement and concrete products to construction projects in every sector: industrial, commercial, residential and municipal, with more than 100 aggregate quarries and hundreds of ready-mix concrete plants in the United States.   CEMEX is one of the largest producers of cement in the United States, owning and operating 14 Portland cement kiln plants.   The U.S. headquarters is located in Houston.   The $1.4 million penalty will be distributed between the United States, the state of Ohio and the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency serving Ohios Clark, Darke, Greene, Miami, Montgomery and Preble Counties.   The state will contribute 20 percent of its share of the settlement to Ohio EPAs Clean Diesel School Bus Program Fund.   The proposed consent decree will be lodged with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, and will be subject to a 30-day public comment period. None
