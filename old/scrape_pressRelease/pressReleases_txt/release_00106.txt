The United States sued in federal court in Newnan, Georgia, to permanently bar Lucrezia Finch Henderson from preparing federal income tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The complaint alleges that Henderson unlawfully reported information on her customers returns that resulted in the customers claiming more tax credits and refunds than they were entitled to receive. As alleged in the complaint, Henderson engaged in abusive tax schemes such as reporting fake businesses on her customers returns in order to generate losses to lower their tax liabilities. Henderson falsely claimed education credits for customers who did not attend college that year, according to the complaint. According to that complaint, Henderson prepares tax returns at Infinity Tax located at 104 Sage Commercial Drive, Suite B, in Lagrange, Georgia. None None
