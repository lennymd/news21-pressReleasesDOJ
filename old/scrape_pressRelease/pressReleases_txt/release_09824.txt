WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced today that Oddie Tribble, 51, a former deputy sheriff with the Kershaw County, S.C., Sherriffs Office, was sentenced to 63 month in prison and three years of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie for using excessive force on a man in his custody on Aug. 5, 2010. Tribble was also ordered to pay restitution of $5,109.25 to the victim. According to evidence presented at trial, Tribble struck Charles Shelley, 38, a handcuffed arrestee, more than 25 times with a metal baton, lacerating his skin and fracturing his leg. The assault was captured by video cameras at the Kershaw County Detention Center. Eyewitnesses to the beating, including law enforcement officers, testified that they were shocked to see the unjustified attack by a police officer. A jury found Tribble guilty of violating Shelleys rights on Feb. 3, 2011.NoneNone This case was investigated by the Columbia, S.C., Division of the FBI with assistance from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and was prosecuted by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Beth Drake, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tara McGregor, and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Christopher Lomax.
