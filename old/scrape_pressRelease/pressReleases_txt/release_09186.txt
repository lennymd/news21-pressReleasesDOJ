WASHINGTON  Attorney General Eric Holder was joined today by Senior Counselor for Access to Justice Mark Childress at a White House Champions of Change event to honor and recognize the work of legal leaders from communities large and small who are dedicating their professional lives to closing the justice gap in America. The event, co-sponsored by the White House Office of Public Engagement and the Department of Justice Access to Justice Initiative, featured 16 leaders from across the country who were recognized for their work in public interest law and providing legal services to people throughout the country who cannot afford them.Its a privilege to be among so many remarkable individuals who  because of their commitment to progress and to using their skills and talents to improve the lives of others  have been designated by President Obama as Champions of Change, said Attorney General Holder. Across the country, their work is allowing us to address and overcome our most pressing legal challenges and live up to our nations highest ideals.Students, professors, clinicians, pro bono directors and law librarians from 118 law schools nationwide submitted discussion questions and viewed the event via live-stream on the Internet. The discussion included conversations on issues such as how to pursue a career in public interest law; how best to assist disadvantaged members of society through legal knowledge and skills; and how to help specific segments of the population, such as tribal members, individuals facing foreclosure and those needing legal representation.Recipients of the White Houses Champions of Change honors are:NoneNone
