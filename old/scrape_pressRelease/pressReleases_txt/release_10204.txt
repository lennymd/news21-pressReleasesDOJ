  WASHINGTON -- A Massachusetts man was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Providence, R.I., to 12 months and one day in prison for tax evasion related to an FBI investigation of organized crime activity in Rhode Island.      U.S. District Court Chief Judge Mary M. Lisi also ordered Gerald Diodati, 61, of Seekonk, Mass., to pay $194,031 in restitution and to serve three years of supervised release following his prison term.   Diodati pleaded guilty in November 2010 to tax evasion related to his 2003 income tax filings.   Diodatis sentence was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Peter F. Neronha for the District of Rhode Island ; Acting Assistant Attorney General John A. DiCicco of the Tax Division; Richard DesLauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBIs Boston Field Office; and William P. Offord, Special Agent in Charge of the Boston Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)None   According to information presented in court, the FBI established an undercover company, Hemphill Construction, which sought the award of union construction contracts. Diodati began working as a consultant to Hemphill Construction in 2002, operating his own businesses out of the construction companys office in Johnston, R.I.   In 2003, Hemphill Construction was awarded a subcontract after signing a collective bargaining agreement with the Rhode Island Laborers District Council on behalf of three local unions, to perform demolition work at the Rising Sun Mills rehabilitation project in Providence. Hemphill, in turn, subcontracted the work to Diodati through RI Demolition Inc., a company Diodati formed for this purpose. According to information presented during the plea hearing, Diodati suggested to Hemphill in late 2003 that he be paid in cash for the work that his company performed on the Rising Sun Mills project. Diodati proposed that Hemphill keep 20 percent of what he was owed and pay him the balance in cash in order to reduce his taxable income, stating that, Uncle Sam doesnt have to know about it, so it keeps me down in the lower bracket. Diodati later noted that both Hemphill and RI Demolition made money on the scheme and that, the only one who is losing is the government.        According to information presented in court,Diodati requested that the money owed him by Hemphill be paid in cash installments placed in a safety deposit box he opened at a local bank, rather than by business checks. Between December 2003 and March 2004, Diodati received more than $230,000 in cash payments for construction work placed into his safety deposit box. None   The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Scott Lawson of the Criminal Divisions Organized Crime and Racketeering Section and Trial Attorney Jessica Nuzzellilo of the Tax Division.   The case was investigated by the FBI and IRS  Criminal Investigation.
