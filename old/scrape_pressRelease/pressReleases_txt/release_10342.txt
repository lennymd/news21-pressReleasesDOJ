None NoneNoneNone  These guilty pleas are the most recent in a series of pleas by MS-13 gang members to racketeering charges arising out of a multi-year investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations, called "Operation Devil Horns," which targeted MS-13 gang members in the San Francisco Bay area. Castillo, Chinchilla-Linar and Alvarado were previously indicted along with 26 other individuals as part of Operation Devil Horns. Since the original charges against MS-13 were unsealed on Oct. 22, 2008, three superseding indictments have been returned charging additional defendants as well as additional crimes. Sixteen defendants are still pending trial, currently scheduled to begin on March 7, 2011.  An indictment contains merely allegations and the remaining defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys W.S. Wilson Leung, Wil Frentzen and Christine Wong, and Trial Attorney Theryn G. Gibbons of the Criminal Divisions Gang Unit. The case was investigated by ICE Homeland Security Investigations.
