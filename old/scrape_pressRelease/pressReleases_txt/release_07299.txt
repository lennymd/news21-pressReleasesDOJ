The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice announced that CountryMark Refining and Logistics LLC (CountryMark) has agreed to pay a $167,000 civil penalty, perform environmental projects totaling more than $180,000, and spend $18 million on new pollution controls to resolve Clean Air Act (CAA) violations at its refinery, located in Mount Vernon, Ind.Once fully implemented, the pollution controls required by the settlement will reduce emissions of harmful air pollution that can cause respiratory problems, such as asthma, and are significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze, by an estimated 1,000 tons or more per year.This settlement requires CountryMark to install new controls and implement new practices at its refinery to reduce air pollution from all significant sources at the refinery, said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. Notably, CountryMark will be the third refiner to put in place new measures to substantially reduce gas emissions from its flare, and the companys commitment to retrofit diesel school buses will also reduce air emissions that affect the areas residents.Under the settlement, CountryMark will implement new practices and install innovative, cutting-edge pollution controls at its Indiana refinery, said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. These innovative controls include ensuring that pollution control devices, such as flares, are operated properly to minimize pollution emitted into the air and to improve their overall efficiency.Because oil production and refining is an important source of jobs in southwest Indiana, my office worked with our state and federal partners to ensure this settlement agreement is carefully structured to address the violations of law and assist the local community with needed improvements to environmental safety and air quality, said Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, whose office represented the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) in settlement negotiations.The complaint alleges that the company made modifications to its refinery that increased emissions without first obtaining pre-construction permits and installing required pollution control equipment. The CAA requires major sources of air pollution to obtain such permits before making changes that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant. The complaint also alleges CAA violations related to flare operation, the New Source Performance Standards, and applicable requirements for leak detection and repair (LDAR).The settlement requires new and upgraded pollution controls, more stringent emission limits, and aggressive LDAR practices to reduce emissions from refinery equipment and processing units. The settlement also requires new controls on the refinerys flaring devices, which are used to burn-off waste gases. The amount of pollution that flares emit depends on the total amount of waste gases sent to a flare and the efficiency at which the flare is operated when burning those gases. The settlement will ensure proper combustion efficiency for any gases that are sent to a flare and will also cap the total amount of waste gases that can be sent to a flare at the refinery. The flares requirements are part of EPAs national effort to reduce emissions from flares at refineries, petrochemical, and chemical plants.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone
