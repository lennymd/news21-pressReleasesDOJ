Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch today released the following statement regarding yesterdays shooting in Palm Springs, California:Our nations heart is broken yet again by the appalling act of violence that claimed two brave law enforcement officers on Saturday. Officers Jose Gilbert Vega and Lesley Zerebnywere at opposite ends of their careers, but they shared a steadfast devotion to the people they had sworn to serve. In a moment of unimaginable crisis, they stayed true to their oaths, laying down their lives to keep their community safe. My thoughts and prayers  and the thoughts and prayers of the entire U.S. Department of Justice go out to the family, loved ones and colleagues of these two fallen heroes. Let their sacrifice remind each of us of the dangers that brave men and women in law enforcement confront each and every day on our behalf. And let their example inspire each of us to ask what we can do to create a more peaceful, a more united, and a more just society  one worthy of the memory of Officers Vega and Zerebny.
