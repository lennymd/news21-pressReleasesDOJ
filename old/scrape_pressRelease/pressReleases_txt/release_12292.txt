  WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced it has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, Calif., against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), alleging that the CDCR failed to promptly reemploy U.S. Air Force reservist Dany Felix in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).  USERRA was enacted to protect service members from being disadvantaged in their civilian careers due to serving in the uniformed services. Subject to certain limitations, USERRA requires employers to reemploy service members who have been injured while on active duty by accommodating those service members in a position they are qualified to perform and that approximates their pre-service position in seniority, pay and status.NoneNone  "Service members injured during active duty should not be penalized with the loss of their civilian jobs," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.  The Justice Departments lawsuit was filed after receiving Felixs complaint from the Labor Departments Veterans Employment and Training Service, upon completion of its investigation.None
