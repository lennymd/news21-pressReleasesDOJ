NoneNone       In addition to the merger investigation of the KGen transactions, the division has been examining allegations that Entergy has engaged in exclusionary conduct in its four-state utility service area spanning parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.  That investigation remains open.  The conduct investigation has focused on whether certain of Entergys power generation dispatch, transmission planning and power procurement practices constitute exclusionary conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.         If Entergy follows through on its transmission system commitments, the Antitrust Divisions concerns will be resolved.       The division has been investigating the effect of several of Entergys practices on competition and barriers to entry.  The division has also evaluated professed efficiency and regulatory justifications, which have not been persuasive.       Specifically, the division has been exploring whether Entergy has harmed consumers by exercising its control over its transmission system and dominant fleet of gas-fired power plants to exclude rival operators of low-cost combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants from competing to sell long-term power. In particular, the division has been evaluating whether Entergys practices have effectively foreclosed these more efficient rivals from obtaining long-term firm transmission service, a necessary input for selling long-term power products to wholesale customers in the Entergy service area. As part of the conduct investigation, the division has also been reviewing the competitive impact of, and circumstances surrounding, Entergys serial acquisition of rivals CCGT power plants, including the KGen plants.     Since the division began its investigation, Entergy announced that it intends to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) RTO and has entered into an agreement to divest its electric transmission business to ITC Holdings Corp. (ITC), an independent transmission company.  In recent months, Entergy has initiated the state and federal regulatory processes in support of these significant structural changes, secured conditional MISO approval from several state regulators, and committed its utilities to a target MISO integration date of December 2013. None     The division will closely monitor developments, and in the event that Entergy does not make meaningful and timely progress, the division can and will take appropriate enforcement action, if warranted.
