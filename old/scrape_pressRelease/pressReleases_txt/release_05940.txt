The Program for Non-Prosecution Agreements or Non-Target Letters for Swiss Banks (the Program) allows Swiss banks not currently under investigation to come forward to provide cooperation and pay steep penalties in return for the possibility of a non-prosecution agreement or deferred prosecution agreement. The Program expressly excluded banks that were previously authorized for investigation in connection with their Swiss banking activity, 14 at the time of the announcement, and expressly excludes all individuals. The department has received over 100 letters of intent to participate in the Program from Swiss entities. Every Swiss bank that cooperates under the Program represents an opportunity to obtain valuable law enforcement information.
