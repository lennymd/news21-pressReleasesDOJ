  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Monday night after the U.S. Senate voted 93-1 to confirm James Comey as the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation:  Jim Comey is a dedicated public servant who brings an impeccable sense of judgment, a commitment to innovative methods and tools, and a lifetime of experience to a role that is critical to the protection of our nation and its citizens. Ive known Jim for almost 20 years  and I have every confidence that, as he assumes leadership of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he will continue to uphold the standards of excellence and integrity that the FBIs outgoing Director, Bob Mueller, helped to establish. As a seasoned prosecutor, a proven leader, and a faithful servant of the American people, I am confident that Jim will be a superb FBI Director. I applaud the U.S. Senate for approving his nomination. And I look forward to working with him  and with all of the brave men and women who serve the FBI  to continue protecting the American people, ensuring our nations security, and promoting the rule of law while upholding our most treasured values.
