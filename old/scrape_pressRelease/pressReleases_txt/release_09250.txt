      WASHINGTON  Stephan Bekale and Jamal Ibraheem were sentenced today in U.S.  District Court in Alexandria, Va., for conspiring to commit wire fraud as part of a matching funds scheme, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride of the Eastern District of Virginia and Assistant Director in Charge James W. McJunkin of the FBIs Washington Field Office.       None       According to the indictment and information presented in court, Bekale fraudulently obtained matching funds from Bank of Americas charitable arm after he falsely certified that charitable contributions had been made to his nonprofit organization, Hoops for Africa, by Bank of America employees.  Ibraheem is a former Bank of America employee who admitted that he falsely certified donations made in his name and that he recruited additional bank employees to participate in Bekales fraud scheme.        According to court documents, from approximately March 2007 through May 2009, approximately 31 bank employees, located at three different banking locations, logged onto Bank of Americas website for its Matching Gifts Program and certified that they donated money to Hoops for Africa.  The fraudulent employee donations to Hoops for Africa ranged from $1,300 to $7,500 per donation, and a total of 57 matching gift requests were received by Bank of Americas charitable arm.  As a result of those falsely registered donations, Bank of America eventually processed 55 of the transactions and disbursed through its charitable foundation a total of approximately $276,600 in matching gifts to Hoops for Africa.        Bekale and Ibraheem were charged in a 10-count indictment unsealed on April 5, 2011, along with three other defendants.    Irma DeMartini, of Sterling, Va., pleaded guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 21, 2011.  Charges are still pending against co-defendants Reynaldo Christian Villarroel and Maritza Villarroel, and they are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.         This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark D. Lytle of the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Eric L. Gibson of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section.  The case is being investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office.
