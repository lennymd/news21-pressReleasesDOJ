  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice today filed a lawsuit on behalf of Suzanne L. Halverson, an Army National Guard member, against Grand Forks County, N.D., alleging violations of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), which prohibits employers from discriminating against service-members because of their past, current or future military service obligations.  The Departments complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Grand Forks, alleges that Grand Forks County violated USERRA by taking into consideration Ms. Halversons military service obligations when it denied her promotion to a permanent juvenile detention officer position in the countys correctional center.  "Our men and women in uniform must be able to serve their country without fear of being penalized in their civilian careers," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "The Justice Department remains committed to vigorously enforcing federal laws that protect the employment rights of men and women who are serving in our nations military."  The Department of Justice filed the lawsuit after receiving Ms. Halversons complaint from the Veterans Employment and Training Service of the Department of Labor (DOL), once DOLs investigation and settlement efforts were complete.None
