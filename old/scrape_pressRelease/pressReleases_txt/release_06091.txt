None None     The actual implementation of SIRF schemes is often complex to carry out. In an increasing number of cases, the identities are stolen or bought in one place; the returns are electronically filed from another location, often through difficult to trace Wi-Fi connections; refunds are directed to a distant location; checks are cashed in yet another location; and the currency then moves again.       The Department of Justice is committed to constant vigilance in investigating and prosecuting SIRF crimes, said Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally for the Justice Departments Tax Division. Too often the victims of identity theft are the most vulnerable in our communities  those whose identities are stolen from medical services or nursing homes, or grieving families who learn that the identities of deceased loved ones have been fraudulently used  and all honest taxpayers are victims when wrongful refund claims are paid out. We are determined to work with the IRS to stop this crime at the door, and to seek the conviction and punishment of these criminals.     Some of the prosecutions from 2013 that resulted in significant prison sentences for SIRF crimes include:  NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone      "We're fighting identity theft head-on at the IRS and making substantial progress with the help of the Justice Department and local law enforcement," said Commissioner John Koskinen for the IRS. "We're stopping more identity theft before these fraudulent refunds go out the door. The IRS initiated nearly 1,500 identity theft related criminal investigations last year, an increase of 66 percent over 2012. Fighting fraud is an ongoing battle as identity thieves continue to create new ways of stealing personal information. The IRS is continually reviewing ourpolicies to strengthen our systems, minimize the incidence of identity theft and help victims.        The sentences imposed against those committing SIRF crimes are significant and reflect the seriousness of these crimes. The Justice Department is committed to investigating and prosecuting tax refund fraud that involves identity theft, and will continue to work with the IRS, FBI, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, other federal law enforcement agencies as well as state and local law enforcement agencies to combat SIRF-related crimes. Each U.S. Attorneys Office has a point of contact to coordinate SIRF matters for its district.  None None
