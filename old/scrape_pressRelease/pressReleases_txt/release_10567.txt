  WASHINGTON  U.S. Army Major Roderick D. Sanchez pleaded guilty today to a one-count criminal information charging him with bribery for accepting money and items of value in return for being influenced in the awarding of Army contracts, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.  Sanchez, 45, of Pueblo, Colo., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. According to court documents, at various times from approximately 2004 through 2007, Sanchez was employed by the U.S. Army and deployed overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait as a contracting officer. Sanchezs duties included reviewing bids submitted by contractors for Army contracts, recommending the award of Army contracts to specific contractors, and ultimately awarding those contracts to government contractors. Sanchez admitted that during that time period he accepted illicit bribe payments from foreign companies seeking to secure Army contracts. In return, Sanchez used his official position to steer Army contracts to these companies. During the course of this criminal scheme, Sanchez accepted Rolex watches, cash payments and other things of value totaling more than $200,000.  Sanchez faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, a fine of $250,000 and five years of supervised release following his prison term. Sanchez is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 19, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Christine M. Arguello.  This case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Justin V. Shur and Trial Attorney Eric L. Gibson of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section. The case is being investigated by the FBI, Army Criminal Investigation Command, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.
