From January 2006 through April 15, 2013, Sherri Davis and Andre Davis conspired with others to defraud the IRS by preparing and filing false income tax returns that contained fraudulent deductions, expenses, losses and credits to which 2FT and DFS clients were not entitled, thereby generating fraudulent income tax refunds.The superseding indictment alleges that Sherri Davis and Andre Davis falsified tax documents for 2FT and DFS clients in order to reduce their taxable income and to get a larger refund than what the client was entitled to receive.
