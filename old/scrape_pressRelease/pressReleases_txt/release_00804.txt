None According to documents filed with the court, from February 2010 through March 2011, Damyon Shuler, 47, approached relatives and others and told them that he could claim slave reparations on their behalf by filing tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for which he charged a $4,000 to $5,000 fee. Shuler then filed 30 returns with the IRS on behalf of other taxpayers, claiming bogus refunds of between $48,184 and $61,300 on each return. To generate the fraudulent refunds, Shuler reported fake capital gains income and taxes paid on that income in the exact same amount. He also attached to each return a form falsely reporting that a Treasury Department office or program identified as Overpayment of Black Invest Taxes had paid the taxes to the IRS. To conceal that he prepared these returns, Shuler did not list himself as the preparer. Shuler also filed a fraudulent 2009 income tax return for himself claiming a refund of $46,685 based on the same scheme. In total, Shulers fraudulent refund scheme led to losses of more than $1.2 million.
