      WASHINGTON  A Gulfport, Miss., newspaper has agreed to pay $15,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department alleging that the newspaper published advertisements for housing that discriminated against families with children, the Justice Department announced today. None None       Protecting families with children from discrimination on the basis of familial status is one of the basic tenets of the Fair Housing Act, said John Dowdy, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi. Our office is committed to ensuring that media outlets such as newspapers do not run ads which violate that principle. Aggressive enforcement of the Fair Housing Act to prevent discrimination against families with children remains a priority of my office.        Newspaper ads that discriminate against families with children are illegal and unacceptable, said John Trasvia,   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)   Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. HUD and the Department of Justice will ensure that publications fulfill their obligation under the Fair Housing Act to reject discriminatory advertisements that limit housing opportunities for families with children.
