The Justice Department today announced an agreement with J & R Associates, the owner and operator of the Royal Park Apartments in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, to resolve allegations of discrimination against families with children in violation of the Fair Housing Act.The lawsuit, filed today in U.S. District Court of the District of Massachusetts, alleges that J & R Associates discriminated against families with children seeking to rent units at Royal Park Apartments by maintaining and enforcing policies that segregate families with children in certain buildings and restrict them to certain floors and units within the 224-unit complex. The allegations are based on evidence generated by the departments Fair Housing Testing Program, in which individuals pose as renters to gather information about possible discriminatory practices.Under the terms of the agreement, which is in the form of a consent order and still must be approved by the court, J & R Associates will establish a settlement fund in the amount of $135,000 to compensate victims of their discriminatory practices. The defendant also will pay $7,500 in civil penalties to the United States. The agreement requires J & R Associates to take steps to ensure that families with children no longer are restricted from renting units anywhere at Royal Park Apartments.Discrimination against families because they have children limits their ability to find suitable housing and will not be tolerated, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We appreciate the defendants cooperation with our investigation and willingness to resolve the claims.Families should be able to rent and live where they choose, without being discriminated against because they have children, said U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz of the District of Massachusetts. My office remains committed to enforcing federal civil rights laws to ensure equality for the residents in this district.None
