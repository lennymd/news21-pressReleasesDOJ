  WASHINGTON  Two individuals were sentenced this week in Atlanta for their involvement in a counterfeit DVD and CD ring, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates for the Northern District of Georgia.  Charles Ndhlovu, 34, was sentenced on Dec. 12, 2011, by U.S. District Judge William S. Duffey Jr. to 51 months in prison and Scott Ahn, 42, was sentenced yesterday by Judge Duffey to 19 months in prison. Ndhlovu and Ahn also were ordered to serve three years of supervised release following their prison terms. Ahn was ordered to pay $25,000 in restitution to the Recording Industry Association of America and $15,000 in restitution to the Motion Picture Association of America.  Ahn pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2010, to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, to traffic in counterfeit goods and to traffic in counterfeit labels. Ndhlovu was convicted by a federal jury on July 28, 2011, of one count of trafficking in counterfeit labels and two counts of criminal copyright infringement.  These sentences send an important message that criminal counterfeiting will not be tolerated, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. The sale of counterfeit goods and the theft of intellectual property harm businesses, consumers and artists alike. We will continue to investigate and prosecute individuals who seek to profit illegally by stealing the works of others, including those who knowingly support the criminal activity.  These defendants mass-produced hundreds of thousands of counterfeit music CDs and DVD movies in a pirating operation that appeared to be the largest of its kind in the southeastern United States, said U.S. Attorney Yates. Their victims included consumers, who were not getting genuine products, as well as the thousands of Americans who earn their livelihoods from the legitimate creation of their art.NoneNone
