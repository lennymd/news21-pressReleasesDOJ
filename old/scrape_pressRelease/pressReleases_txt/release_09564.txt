    WASHINGTON  The owner of an investment planning company in Miami was sentenced today to 63 months in prison for his role in a scheme to defraud the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) of $5.2 million, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and Osvaldo L. Gratacos, Inspector General of the Ex-Im Bank.     Carlos L. Morano, 51, was sentenced by Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga in U.S. District Court in Miami.  In addition to his prison term, Morano was sentenced to three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay $5.2 million in restitution and $6.8 million in forfeiture. Morano pleaded guilty on May 6, 2011, to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud the Ex-Im Bank of approximately $5.2 million.  Morano, a naturalized U.S. Citizen, most recently resided in Buenos Aires, Argentina, until his arrest on Nov. 8, 2010, in Atlanta, where he arrived after an international flight from Argentina.  The warrant for his arrest was obtained by Ex-Im Office of Inspector General (OIG) Special Agents. None     According to court records, all of the loans involving Morano were fraudulent.  As a result of the fraud, the loans went into default, causing the Ex-Im Bank to pay claims losses to the lending banks in the amount of $5,219,756.      The Ex-Im Bank is an independent federal agency that helps create and maintain U.S. jobs by filling gaps in private export financing.

The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Patrick Donley and William Bowne of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section.  The case was investigated by the Ex-Im Bank OIG.
