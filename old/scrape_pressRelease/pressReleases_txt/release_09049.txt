    Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement today on the passing of former   Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Jack Keeney:      For the last six decades, Jack Keeney served the Department of Justice with dedication, integrity and an unshakeable commitment to the rule of law. As the longest-serving federal prosecutor in the history of the United States, the contributions that he made  to the Justice Department and to the nation he was so proud to serve  are beyond measure. And I am one of many who have been grateful to count him as a mentor, advisor and friend.    Although Mr. Keeney will be sorely missed, his legacy will live on  in the Justice Department building that bears his name, in the standard of excellence that he established in the departments Criminal Division, in the work of countless attorneys that he mentored throughout his career, and in the inspiration that he will continue to provide public servants across our nation.
