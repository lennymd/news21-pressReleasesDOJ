None"Tribal communities have spoken and the Department of Justice has listened and responded. When I met with tribal leaders last year, during the Tribal Nations Listening Session, I pledged that the Justice Department would act quickly to address the issues they identified that could make significant improvements in tribal communities across the United States," said Attorney General Holder. "We have learned from our meetings with tribal leaders that difficulties accessing some of the Justice Departments information, especially information about grant opportunities, have been an obstacle for many communities. This new Web site will remove this obstacle, and help the Justice Department work more effectively with tribal communities to improve public safety."The new site features an easy to navigate format and access to the latest announcements, press releases, speeches and information regarding Department of Justice initiatives in tribal communities. It also provides comprehensive resources available through the Office of Tribal Justice and the departments grant-making divisions: the Office of Justice Programs, Community Oriented Policing Services and the Office on Violence Against Women.Access to the departments Combined Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS) is also available on the Web site. Last month, the department announced the creation of CTAS, a newly streamlined grant program for federally-recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities, governments and consortiums to apply for Fiscal Year 2010 funding opportunities. Todays announcement is another step in the Justice Departments ongoing initiative to increase engagement, coordination and action on public safety in tribal communities.
