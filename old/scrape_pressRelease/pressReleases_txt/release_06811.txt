  Contrack International Inc., a global design and construction company headquartered in McLean, Va., has agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle allegations that it submitted false claims in connection with U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contracts, the Justice Department announced today.  Misrepresentations during contract negotiations undermine the integrity of the government procurement process, said Stuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. The Justice Department will take action where contractors misrepresent their qualifications for government contracts and programs.None  This settlement  which resolves only Contracks liability  was the result of a coordinated effort by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch; the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Idaho; and the USAID Office of Inspector General. The government is continuing to pursue its claims against the other two defendants in the suit.  The case is United States v. Washington Group International Inc. f/k/a/ Morrison Knudsen, Corporation; Contrack International, Inc.; and Misr Sons Development S.A.E. a/k/a Hassan Allam Sons, No. 04-555 (N.D. Idaho). The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
