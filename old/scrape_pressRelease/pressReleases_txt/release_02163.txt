The Justice Departments Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) today announced 61 grants totaling $25 million to help students who are victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. In fiscal year 2016, OVW is awarding twice as many grants (45) to institutions of higher education compared to last year. Also this year, OVW is awarding 16 grants to organizations that will provide legal assistance to victims on campuses.The recipients of these competitive awards will work to deliver effective, comprehensive and coordinated strategies that help survivors heal; reduce campus sexual and domestic violence; and improve the institutions response to these crimes. The awards will make possible a range of services, including specialized training for campus law enforcement, healthcare providers, university housing personnel and others who are often first responders. The Legal Assistance for Victims Program grant recipients will assist students  who generally do not know about legal options and resources  with legal needs associated with these crimes.NoneSchools that individualize their response to sexual, dating and domestic violence are better able to meet the unique needs of their student populations, especially underserved groups, said OVW Principal Deputy Director Bea Hanson, Ph.D. Coordinated, comprehensive responses allow college communities to develop sustainable strategies to address these crimes.NoneNoneRecipients of Awards under OVWs Campus Grant ProgramNonePeace Over Violence (California); Pine Tree Legal Assistance (Maine); Casa Myrna Vazquez (Massachusetts); Tubman (Minnesota); Legal Services Eastern Missouri; SAFE Harbor (Montana); Capital District Womens Bar Association Legal Project (New York); Sanctuary for Families (New York); Legal Aid Society Rochester (New York); Unity House of Troy (New York); Victim Rights Law Center (Massachusetts); Prairie State Legal Services (Illinois); End Domestic Abuse/Wisconsin Coalition; Mid-Minnesota Legal Services; Manhattan Legal Services (New York); and Legal Aid Society of Mid-NY.* * *OVW provides leadership in developing the nations capacity to reduce violence against women through the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act and subsequent legislation.
