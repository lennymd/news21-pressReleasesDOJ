A Fort Lauderdale, Florida resident was indicted today for tax evasion, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division.  According to the indictment, between 2002 and 2015, Thomas Daly earned more than $1.5 million in income working as a salesman for several companies. The indictment alleges that Daly has not filed a federal tax return since 2002, with the exception of the 2007 tax year. In August 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified Daly that it intended to levy his wages to collect his unpaid tax liabilities for 2002 through 2006. Allegedly, in an effort to evade the collection of his back taxes, Daly incorporated South Florida Home Marketing Inc. (SFHM) to serve as his nominee and alter ego. Daly allegedly entered into an agreement with his employer to receive his wages in the name of SFHM. The indictment charges that as a result, the IRSs levy was unsuccessful. Daly also allegedly directed others to make payments to him in the name of SFHM and used the income deposited into SFHMs bank account to pay personal expenses, including apartment rent, a boat, international travel, entertainment, his girlfriends cosmetic surgery and jewelry.  An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Daly faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison for each tax evasion count. Daly also faces a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg commended special agents of IRSCriminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorneys Charles M. Edgar, Jr. and Michael C. Boteler of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case with assistance from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida. None
