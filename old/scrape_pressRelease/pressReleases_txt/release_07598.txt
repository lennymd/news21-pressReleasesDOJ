A federal court has permanently barred Larry Carnell Dixon Sr., a Louisiana tax return preparer, and his business, Dixons Tax Service, LLC from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order, to which Dixon and Dixons Tax Service LLC, consented without admitting the allegations against them, was signed by Judge James Brady of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.NoneThe amended complaint alleged that Dixon and the preparers at Dixons Tax Service fabricated and inflated business expense deductions reported on many of their taxpayers Schedule Cs (Forms 1040) for existing and fictional businesses. By allegedly fabricating and inflating these deductions, Dixon and Dixons Tax Service reduced a clients taxable income, which resulted in a reduced tax liability and possibly a higher refund. In addition, Dixon and his preparers have allegedly repeatedly prepared returns that claim the EITC for customers who did not qualify for it. The complaint alleges that Dixons alleged misconduct may have cost the United States as much as $39 million.The IRS lists tax-preparer fraud as one of the Dirty Dozen tax scams. The Justice Department has obtained injunctions against hundreds of tax-return preparers and tax-fraud promoters in the past decade. Information about these cases is available on the Justice Department website.NoneNoneNone
