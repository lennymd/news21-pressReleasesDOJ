WASHINGTON , DC  Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justices Access to Justice Initiative co-hosted a Middle Class Task Force event today with Vice President Joe Biden, announcing a series of steps designed to help middle class and low-income families secure their legal rights. These actions include strengthening foreclosure mediation programs, helping veterans secure the legal help they need, and making it easier for workers to find a qualified attorney when they believe their rights have been violated.NoneTodays announcement is the culmination of work between the Department of Justices (DOJ) Access to Justice Initiative and federal agencies like the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as partners in the advocacy community.NoneMany peoples lives can be improved without major new investments, and in fact with real savings, if we simply help them access the legal rights and benefits that are theirs. Thats why the Department's Access to Justice Initiative is honored to work with the Vice President, HUD, the Labor Department, and the VA to make justice a reality.  said DOJ Senior Counselor for Access to Justice Laurence Tribe.Legal Support for WorkersThe Department of Labor and the American Bar Association (ABA) today announced a collaboration to help workers resolve complaints received by DOLs Wage and Hour Division, such as not getting paid the minimum wage or not being paid overtime, or being denied family medical leave. Beginning on December 13, 2010, complainants whose cases cannot be resolved by DOL because of limited capacity will be given a toll-free number to a newly created system where they are connected to an ABA-approved attorney referral provider if there are participating attorneys in their area.In addition, if DOL has conducted an investigation, the complainant will be given information about the findings to provide to an attorney who may take the case, including the violations at issue and any back wages owed. DOL has also developed a special process for complainants and representing attorneys to obtain relevant case information and documents when available.NoneVeterans Access to Legal HelpToday the Vice President announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) have launched an awareness campaign between the VAs community-based Vet Centers and local LSC legal aid service providers to help veterans better address legal challenges in areas such as foreclosure, consumer fraud, and employment issues. The first phase of the new awareness campaign is already underway.LSC-funded programs have reached out to 51 Vet Centers operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the mid-Atlantic region, Maine, and Arkansas to share information about legal services and to create appropriate referral systems to minimize veterans frustration in obtaining advice and representation on civil legal problems.NoneNoneForeclosure mediation programs are designed to identify alternatives to foreclosure that benefit both the homeowner and the lender.
