None  The anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) demands that employers not place additional barriers in front of work-authorized, non-U.S. citizens before allowing them to work, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. This resolution is further evidence that the Civil Rights Division is committed to making that demand of equal treatment a reality in Americas worksites.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Indrescom agrees to pay $7,000 in back pay to the charging party, train its human resources personnel about employers responsibilities to avoid discrimination in the employment eligibility verification process and be subject to reporting and compliance monitoring requirements for three years.  The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) is responsible for enforcing the anti-discrimination provisions of the INA, which protect U.S. citizens and certain work-authorized individuals from citizenship status discrimination. The INA also protects all work-authorized individuals from national origin discrimination, over-documentation in the employment eligibility verification process and retaliation.None
