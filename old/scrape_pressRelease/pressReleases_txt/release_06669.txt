NoneNoneNoneNoneNone None       This settlement illustrates the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by Attorney General Eric Holder and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $14.8 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $10.8 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.       The settlement was the result of a coordinated effort among the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida, the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Departments Civil Division, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General and Office of Counsel to the Inspector General, and the Florida Attorney Generals Office.
