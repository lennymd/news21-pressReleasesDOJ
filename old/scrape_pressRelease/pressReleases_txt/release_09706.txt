Breuer of the Justice Departments Criminal Division.   Derrick L. Shoemake, 49, of Moreno Valley, Calif., pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Gee in the Central District of California to a criminal information charging him with two counts of bribery.   According to the court document, Major Shoemake was deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, as a contracting officers representative in charge of coordinating and accepting delivery of bottled water in support of U.S. troops in Iraq.   While serving in Kuwait, Shoemake agreed to assist a contractor with his delivery of bottled water.   In return, the contractor paid Shoemake a total of approximately $215,000, most of which was delivered to Shoemakes designee in Los Angeles.   Shoemake received an additional $35,000 from a second contractor for his perceived influence over the award of bottled water contracts in Afghanistan.   In total, Shoemake admitted receiving approximately $250,000 from these two government contractors in 2005 and 2006.

Additionally, Shoemake has agreed to criminal forfeiture of $250,000 to the United States.   A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled by the court.   As a result of this investigation 17 individuals, including Shoemake, have pleaded guilty or been found guilty at trial for their roles in the schemes at Camp Arifjan. None
