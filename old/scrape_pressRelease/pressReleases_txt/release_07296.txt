      The Department of Justices Office on Violence Against Women (OVW  ) today announced $12.6 million dollars in grants awarded to 20communities as part of a new, consolidated program designed to   more effectively reduce dating violence  . For the first time, grantees can implement a comprehensive approach to dating violence that includes services for victims, prevention programs, partnering with schools and engaging men and boys in   ending violence against women  . OVW combined four separate grant programs into one, enabling more efficient, effective work and responding to the call for bold new initiatives from The Attorney Generals Task Force on Children Exposed to Violence.        Grantees of the Consolidated GrantProgram toAddress Children and Youth Experiencing Domestic and Sexual Violence and Engaging Men and Boys as Allies will provide services to children and youthexposed to violence, training for professionals to improve interventions and responses, coordinated school-based strategies, supportive services for non-abusing parents and coordinated community responses. The Program also supports innovative prevention strategies that encourage men and boys to work as allies with women and girls to prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.        Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West   announced the grants to a room full of high school and college students at a White House event commemorating Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.       Teen dating violence is about our community, our schools and our relationships. And that means its about us. Each one of us, as well as, importantly, those of us who are men, Acting Associate Attorney General West said. As fathers, brothers, coaches, teachers and classmates  mens voices must be part of this conversation  as men, both young and old, this is our individual and collective responsibility.  None       Every year, millions of children and adolescents across the United States are victimized and exposed to violence in their homes and neighborhoods, and often suffer severe, long-term emotional and physical consequences, said Acting Director of OVW Bea Hanson. As we work to help keep our children safe, we must view prevention and intervention as intertwined, not separate and distinct. This grant program is an essential part of our vision for safe and healthy communities, places where young people can grow to their fullest potential.       Grantees will receive awards ranging from $350,000 to $1,000,000 based on the scope of their projects.
