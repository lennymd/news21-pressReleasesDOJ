The Justice Department filed suit today asking the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida to permanently bar Torrey Burden from preparing federal tax returns for others. The civil injunction suit alleges that Burden prepares returns through A&L Financial Solutions in St. Petersburg, Fla.According to the complaint, Burden prepares tax returns using false information in order to reduce his customers tax liabilities. Specifically, the government alleges that Burden claims false or overstated deductions and claims tax credits that his customers were not eligible to claim. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined 80 returns prepared by Burden and found that 92.5 percent resulted in additional taxes owed. As alleged in the complaint, the IRS projects that the tax loss from the returns prepared by Burden could exceed $1,000,000.NoneNone
