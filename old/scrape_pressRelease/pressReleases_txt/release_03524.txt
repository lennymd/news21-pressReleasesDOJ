The Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced $1.5 million in new federal grants focused on violence prevention efforts in Baltimore.Joining Administrator Robert L. Listenbee of the Justice Departments Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at a press conference to announce the grants were Deputy Director Kristina Rose of the Justice Departments Office for Victims of Crime, Regional Director Joanne Grossi of the Department of Health and Human Services, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen.At the Department of Justice, we firmly believe that a public health approach  one that fights not just the symptoms but the root causes of violence  is the most effective and sustainable way to prevent and reduce crime in our communities, said Administrator Listenbee. What is so tremendously gratifying about these efforts is that they are all the direct result of partnerships  between Safe Streets Baltimore, the health department, the schools, the faith community and agencies across the federal government. We are proud to make these investments and honored to be part of this exciting work.Violence devastates individuals and families and can undermine the very fabric of our communities, said Regional Director Grossi. The good news is that there is hope  we know what works to prevent violence. The federal government is looking forward to collaborating with NACCHO and the city of Baltimore to prevent the violence and foster a safe and healthy environment for all residents.The three grants from the U.S. Department of Justice include:$999,564 from the Office for Victims of Crime to more effectively reach male survivors of violence and their families.During the three-year project period, these partners will convene a planning group to develop a culturally-relevant, trauma-informed curriculum for survivors, establish a standardized and multidisciplinary shooting response protocol and implement a plan to increase public awareness of the effects of trauma and victimization.$278,000 from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention to implement strategies and evidence-based programs to reduce youth violence.As a means of addressing school climate issues, the Baltimore City Health Department and the Baltimore Public School System aim to enhance the capacity of schools to successfully implement and sustain the school-wide positive behavioral interventions and support (PBIS) model.$70,000 from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to integrate the faith community into activities aimed at the prevention and reduction of youth violence and victimization within and around the Safe Streets Baltimore areas.Specifically, this funding will support a Faith Community Coordinator position to conduct outreach to Baltimores diverse faith-based community which serves and surrounds the Safe Streets areas.Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has awarded the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) with $175,000 to fund a pilot of Safe Streets in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore.A request for proposals is currently offering community-based organizations in West Baltimore the opportunity to bring the program credited with reducing gun violence to their neighborhoods.In 2014, Safe Streets workers had 15,000 client interactions and mediated 880 conflicts. More than 80 percent of interactions were deemed to be likely or very likely to result in gun violence. Three of the four sites have gone over a year without a fatal shooting.
