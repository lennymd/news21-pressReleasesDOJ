NoneNone        Child sexual abuse online, a substantial problem worldwide, is a crime that is ubiquitous and knows no borders.   Child pornography images circulate easily across jurisdictions, and efforts to reduce such circulation have failed to produce satisfactory results to date.  Child pornography offenders are increasingly operating in international online groups that use sophisticated technologies and security protocols to frustrate the efforts of law enforcement to investigate their crimes.  Different laws and policies across jurisdictions also have created law enforcement vulnerabilities that these international offenders are exploiting.  Therefore, we need to act together to successfully confront the problem.        The Global Alliance will seek to unite countries around the world behind a set of shared goals:          We invite partners from around the world to join the Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online.
