The Justice Department announced today that it has entered into a settlement to resolve allegations that the city of Selma, Texas, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by engaging in retaliation against a firefighter for filing a complaint against a superior for using ethnic slurs in the workplace.The departments complaint alleges that the city discriminated against Adam Sadler, who is employed by the city, by demoting him from lieutenant to firefighter because he filed a complaint regarding the fire chiefs use of ethnic slurs in the workplace. Title VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against an individual for opposing any employment practice that would violate Title VII, for filing a complaint of discrimination, or for assisting in the investigation of such a complaint.NoneTitle VII protects employees who oppose workplace discrimination from retaliation. A person cannot be demoted from his position simply because he reports the use of discriminatory language in the workplace by a supervisor, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice is committed to enforcing Title VIIs anti-retaliation provisions, which are critical to ensure effective protection from discrimination.We are pleased that the city of Selma has agreed to additional EEO training for its staff, said Robert L. Pitman, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas.All public servants must be held to a high standard when it comes to treating one another  as well as the public  with dignity, respect, and equality.NoneNone
