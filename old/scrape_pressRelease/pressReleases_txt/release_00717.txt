The Justice Department today responded to seven jurisdictions following a preliminary assessment of the jurisdictions compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373. These jurisdictions were identified in a May 2016 report by the Department of Justices Inspector General as having laws that potentially violate 8 U.S.C. 1373.  The following jurisdictions have preliminarily been found to have laws, policies, or practices that may violate 8 U.S.C. 1373:   The department found no evidence that the following jurisdictions are currently out of compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373:   The department also previously sent letters to the following jurisdictions notifying them that the department found no evidence that they are currently out of compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373:   Jurisdictions that were found to have possible violations of 8 U.S.C 1373 will have until Oct. 27, 2017 to provide additional evidence that the interpretation and application of their laws, policies, or practices comply with the statute.  Jurisdictions that adopt so-called sanctuary policies also adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. I commend the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Office and the State of Connecticut on their commitment to complying with Section 1373, and I urge all jurisdictions found to be out of compliance in this preliminary review to reconsider their policies that undermine the safety of their residents. We urge jurisdictions to not only comply with Section 1373 but to establish sensible and effective partnerships to properly process criminal aliens.
