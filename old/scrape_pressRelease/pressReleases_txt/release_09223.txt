      WASHINGTON  Three federal courts have issued decisions in favor of the United States in three separate cases involving abusive tax shelters, the Justice Department announced today.  All of the court opinions were issued on Sept. 30, 2011. None None None       These three significant decisions are further evidence that the courts will not countenance abusive tax shelters, no matter who designs them or how complicated they are, said John A. DiCicco, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Tax Division.  Large corporations and wealthy individuals should think twice before pouring money into these sham arrangements.         Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General DiCicco thanked all of the Tax Division and IRS attorneys and investigators involved in these cases for their efforts. None
