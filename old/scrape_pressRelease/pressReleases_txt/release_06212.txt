      The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today that on Jan. 21, 2014, a federal jury in Palm Beach, Fla., convicted Paul F. Wrubleski, a resident of Weston, Fla., of one count of corruptly impeding the due administration of the internal revenue laws and four counts of filing false claims for tax refunds. Wrubleski was remanded into custody yesterday.       According to court documents and the evidence presented at trial, Wrubleski had a decade-long pattern of filing false documents with the IRS. Wrubleski impeded the IRS by filing false W-4 forms that claimed he was exempt from income tax withholding and by filing false tax returns, including four tax returns that requested over $1.5 million in federal refunds. Wrubleski also sent obstructive letters, tax returns and other false documents to the IRS between 1999 and 2010. In addition, the indictment alleged and the evidence proved that Wrubleski filed for bankruptcy in 2006 in order to impede IRS collection actions.       Sentencing is scheduled for April 3, 2014. Wrubleski faces a statutory maximum potential sentence of 23 years in prison and faces a fine of up to $1.2 million.       Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally of the Tax Division commended the efforts of special agents of IRS  Criminal Investigation who investigated the case, as well as Tax Division Trial Attorneys Charles Edgar Jr. and Jed Silversmith, who prosecuted the case, with local assistance from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida.
