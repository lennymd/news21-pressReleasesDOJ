  Ira Isaacs, 60, was found guilty today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on one count of engaging in the business of producing and selling obscene videos and four counts of distributing obscene videos, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Andr Birotte Jr. of the Central District of California, Assistant Director in Charge Steve Martinez of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office, and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck.  A federal jury in the Central District of California found Isaacs guilty on all charged counts of a superseding indictment filed in April 2011.   Evidence presented at trial established that beginning in or about 1999 and continuing until at least 2011, Isaacs, doing business under the name L.A. Media, operated numerous websites, through which he advertised and sold obscene videos which he acquired from other persons. The obscene videos included a video approximately two hours in length of a female engaging in sex acts involving human bodily waste and a video one hour and 37 minutes in length of a female engaged in sex acts with animals.   The evidence presented at trial also established that in or about 2004, Isaacs began operating under the name Stolen Car Films, and made obscene videos in which he instructed women to engage in sexual activity involving human bodily waste. He subsequently advertised and sold the videos through his various websites.   Isaacs is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 6, 2012.   The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Michael W. Grant and Deputy Chief Damon King of the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), with the assistance of Jeannette Gunderson, a trial attorney with the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section. The investigation was conducted by the FBI and Los Angeles Police Department.
