NoneCCIPS is the cornerstone of the departments anti-cybercrime efforts, and has been involved in one capacity or another in practically every significant cybercrime and intellectual property case that has been in the public eye, said Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division. And CCIPS has been performing that role for 20 years, long before terms like data breach or the darknet became common references.CCIPS was established on Oct. 13, 1996, from an earlier five-attorney Computer Crime Unit formed in 1991 within the divisions General Litigation and Legal Advice Section. In 20 years, CCIPSs membership has grown to more than 40 attorneys, in addition to nine digital investigative analysts who comprise the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab. Section attorneys regularly run complex investigations; resolve unique legal and investigative issues raised by emerging computer and telecommunications technologies; litigate cases; provide litigation support to other prosecutors; train federal, state and local law enforcement personnel; comment on and propose legislation; promote cybersecurity; and initiate and participate in international efforts to combat computer and intellectual property crime.Since 1996, the section has prosecuted cases involving hundreds of millions of pieces of stolen information, including credit card and debit card numbers, email addresses, social security numbers and other personally identifying information; hundreds of millions of dollars of trade secrets, including highly sensitive technologies and agricultural products; tens of millions of counterfeit products and copyrighted works, ranging from pharmaceutical products and military supplies to digital media; and millions of compromised computers victimized by botnets and ransomware.NoneNoneNoneCCIPS also acts as a focal point for national and global networks of trained computer and intellectual property crime prosecutors. The section coordinates the nationwide Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property prosecutor network, which is made up of dedicated computer and IP crime prosecutors in every U.S Attorneys Office. In cooperation with the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development and Training, CCIPS also manages regional Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator placements around the world.NoneThe section has shown a truly remarkable ability to respond to emerging threats and rapid technological change, said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. In the next 20 years, I expect that CCIPS will continue to be a leader for the department.
