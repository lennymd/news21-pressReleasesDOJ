  Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division Kathryn Keneally and U.S. Attorney Daniel G. Bogden for the District of Nevada today announced that Arthur Risser Jr., of Las Vegas, pleaded guilty to filing a false personal tax return for 2008.   According to the plea agreement, Risser earned over $100,000 each year during 2006 through 2008 while employed as a large engine mechanic from 2006 to 2008, at Aggregate Industries Southern Nevada Paving Inc. and, during 2006 and 2007, at Las Vegas Paving Corporation. Risser intentionally understated his wages and listed inflated amounts for withheld taxes to increase his refund on his individual income tax returns for 2006, 2007 and 2008. According to the indictment, Risser earned over $300,000 from 2006 to 2008 but only reported $54,472 of income on his federal tax returns for those three years.   Risser faces a potential maximum prison term of three years and a maximum fine of $250,000. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 13, 2013, before U.S. District Judge Andrew P. Gordon.   Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally and U.S. Attorney Daniel G. Bogden thanked special agents of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Dickinson and Tax Division Trial Attorney Sonia M. Owens, who prosecuted the case.
