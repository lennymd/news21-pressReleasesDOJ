  WASHINGTON  Following his recent visit to Chicago where he participated in a  roundtable discussion with Mayor Emanuel on recent reductions in youth violence,  Attorney General Eric Holder today announced plans to send seven additional  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), agents to the field  division office in Chicago.None  In addition, U.S. Attorney Zachary T. Fardon announced a restructuring of the  Criminal Division in his office and in doing so named a team of prosecutors who  will work specifically to reduce violent crime in the city.  The FBI currently  has over 100 agents in Chicago assigned to curb gang and violent crimes.  During  the summer months, the city temporarily assigned an additional 20 agents to  supplement crime reduction efforts.  Under the 12 current grants administered by  our Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention alone, the City of  Chicago and Cook County has access to more than $6.6 million to further these  efforts to address youth violence.  Gun crime is the primary driver of homicide in Chicago, and sixty percent of  the guns recovered in violent crimes in Chicago were originally sold in other  states and trafficked into the city.  Given the interstate nature of these  crimes, it is critical that federal and local law enforcement work together to  identify traffickers and enforce federal gun laws.  ATF will continue to  concentrate its criminal enforcement on firearms trafficking throughout the  region while curbing the supply of illegal guns that end up in the hands of gang  members and other violent criminals.None
