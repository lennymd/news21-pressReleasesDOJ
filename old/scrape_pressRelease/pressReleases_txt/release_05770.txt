According to court documents and the evidence presented at trial, Wrubleski had a decade-long pattern of filing false documents with the IRS. Wrubleski impeded the IRS by filing false IRS forms that claimed he was exempt from income tax withholding and by filing false tax returns, including four tax returns that requested over $1.5 million in federal refunds. Wrubleski also sent obstructive letters, tax returns and other false documents to the IRS between 1999 and 2010. In addition, the indictment alleged and the evidence proved that Wrubleski filed for bankruptcy in 2006 in order to impede IRS collection actions.     In addition to the term of imprisonment, Wrubleski was ordered to pay $79,963 in restitution and to serve three years of supervise release following his release from jail.     The case was investigated by special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorney Charles M. Edgar Jr. of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Bertha R.
