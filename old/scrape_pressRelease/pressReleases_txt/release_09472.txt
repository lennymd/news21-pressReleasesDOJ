Boyle in Dallas, the Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.   Richardson admitted that within a two day period from April 15, 2006, to April 17, 2006, he filed or caused to be filed 29 fraudulent 2005 IRS Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns, according to the written statement filed by Richardson. Each federal income tax return claimed a refund of between $215,801 and $473,832. Richardson admitted that the refunds claimed by all 29 tax returns totaled $7,922,657. Richardson further admitted that each tax return was filed claiming the married filing jointly election and listed two taxpayers, husband and wife.
