  WASHINGTON - Homer Lee Richardson of Loveland, Ohio, was sentenced today for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the due administration of the Internal Revenue Code, aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false income tax return on the behalf of another individual, and filing his own false individual income tax returns for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Justice Department announced. Richardson, a former promoter of sham trust systems, had previously pleaded guilty.  U.S. District Court Senior Judge for the Southern District of Ohio Sandra S. Beckwith sentenced Richardson to 30 months in prison and one year of supervised release. The court also ordered Richardson to pay a $60,000 fine and $61,212 in restitution.  According to the indictment, Richardson marketed and promoted sham trusts for an organization known as Aegis. The trusts had no economic substance or business purpose and falsely gave the appearance that Aegis members relinquished control over their assets. Taxpayers who used these trusts filed false federal individual income tax returns understating their income.  In addition, Richardson attempted to obstruct Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of his own and at least one other individuals income taxes. Finally, Richardson filed his own false tax returns which falsely understated his income.  John A. DiCicco, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Tax Division, commended IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent Ankur Arora, who investigated the case, as well as Tax Division trial attorneys Thomas Voracek and Rita Calvin, who prosecuted the case.None
