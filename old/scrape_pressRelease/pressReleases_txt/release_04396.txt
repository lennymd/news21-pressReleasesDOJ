The Justice Department today filed a lawsuit against the city of Fort Worth, Texas, alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, charges that Fort Worth discriminated against persons with disabilities based on its treatment of a group home for persons recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, including the citys failure to grant a reasonable accommodation to the owner of the group home.The suit seeks a court order prohibiting future discrimination by Fort Worth and requiring Fort Worth to make a reasonable accommodation to permit the continued operation of Ebbys Place as a group home for up to eight individuals with disabilities. It also seeks monetary damages to compensate victims, as well as payment of a civil penalty.This lawsuit arose as a result of a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by Ben Patterson, who through Ebbys Place LLC, owns and operates the group home known as Ebbys Place.The Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act seek to ensure that individuals with disabilities can live in communities of their choice without facing discrimination, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division. We will continue our vigorous enforcement efforts to make certain that persons with disabilities are granted their rights under federal law.While we appreciate the Citys cooperation with this investigation, its refusal, as a governmental entity, to consider those recovering from drug or alcohol addiction as persons with disabilities is at odds with federal law, said Acting U.S. Attorney John Parker of the Northern District of Texas. Simply put, the residents of Ebbys Place are deserving of the same protections as persons with any other disability.Through our Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD is working to ensure that housing options for persons with disabilities are not limited by restrictive zoning rules, said Assistant Secretary Gustavo Velasquez of HUDs Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office.None
