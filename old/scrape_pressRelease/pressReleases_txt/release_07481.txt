The Justice Department announced today that it has sued a Kissimmee, Fla., tax return preparer, seeking to bar him permanently from preparing federal tax returns for others. The civil injunction suit, filed in Orlando, Fla., with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that Carlos A. Cabrera and his business  Cabrera Financial Group  prepare federal income tax returns for customers that claim improper losses for non-existent businesses and fabricated education credits in order to unlawfully understate customers tax liabilities.According to the civil injunction complaint, Cabrera prepared over 17,000 tax returns for 2009 and 2010, with an average tax understatement of $4,222 per return for returns the Internal Revenue Service examined. The government suit alleges that the total losses to the U.S. Treasury from Cabreras misconduct could be tens of millions of dollars for those two years alone.NoneRelated Materials:United States v.
