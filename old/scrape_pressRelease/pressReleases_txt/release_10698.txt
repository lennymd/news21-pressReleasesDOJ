None   RLUIPA protects places of worship and other religious uses of property from discrimination and unreasonably burdensome regulation in zoning and landmarking law, and also protects the religious freedom of persons confined to institutions such as prisons, mental health facilities and state-run nursing homes.   RLUIPA was enacted by both houses of Congress unanimously and signed into law on Sept. 22, 2000.   The law was a response to concerns that places of worship, particularly those of religious and ethnic minorities, were often discriminated against in zoning matters.   The report illustrates that in the 10 years since its enactment, RLUIPA has aided thousands of individuals and institutions from a wide range of faith traditions through Department of Justice lawsuits, private lawsuits, and successful efforts to achieve voluntary compliance.   The report details the Justice Departments enforcement record:  The freedom to practice ones faith in peace is among our most cherished rights.   RLUIPA has proven to be a powerful tool in combating religious discrimination and ensuring religious freedom for all individuals, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.   The Department of Justice is committed to vigorously enforcing RLUIPA to ensure that religious liberty for all remains protected.
