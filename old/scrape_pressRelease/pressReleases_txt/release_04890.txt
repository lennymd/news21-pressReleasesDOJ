Attorney General Eric Holder released the following statement Tuesday on the passing of former Governor Mario Cuomo. The Attorney General Holders travel to New York to attend former Governor Cuomos funeral was canceled due to inclement weather.With the passing of Mario Cuomo, America has lost a giant and a true statesman  a leader of strength and rare humility; of wit and ceaseless compassion.Governor Cuomo was more than a distinguished public servant or a great American success story. Throughout his extraordinary life, he was a tenacious champion for those too often forgotten and too long overlooked. Through his words and his deeds, he gave voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless, and strength to all those who felt that they had been left out or left behind. As the son of Italian immigrants  hailing from my own hometown of Queens, New York  he never forgot his roots. He was always in step with the people he served, and with the glorious immigrant tradition that has always made America so great. His lifes work was inflected with sincere concern for all of his fellow citizens  no matter what they looked like or where they happened to be from. And in his own distinctive voice, he consistently challenged us not only to reach for great and untouched heights, but to extend a hand to those unable to make the journey alone.For decades, I have admired Governor Cuomos unwavering dedication to building an America thats more fair, more free, and more equitable. I last spoke with him a few months ago, and will always be grateful for the advice and support he offered throughout my career. With his loss, a great progressive flame has gone out. But in the hearts of millions of Americans who heard his message, who knew his story, and who benefited from his passionate service, the fire that he ignited burns on.
