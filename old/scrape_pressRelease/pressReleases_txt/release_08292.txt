    Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole paid tribute to four individuals today during the National Missing Childrens Day ceremony at the Justice Departments Great Hall. Deputy Attorney General Cole presented awards to a special agent, a detective, a 30-year veteran of the postal service and a prosecutor for their extraordinary efforts to recover missing children, rescue children from abuse and prosecute sexual predators. This annual ceremony honors missing children, their families, child advocates and those dedicated to the well-being and safety of children. None    Protecting children is one of the important jobs we have, said Deputy Attorney General Cole.   There is no rest for a parent who has lost a child, and there should be no rest for any of us who are in a position to help. There may not be any words we could offer that would ease their pain, but we can and will offer our support  and all the tools at our disposal to help families of missing and exploited children. I am honored to recognize those who work on the front lines to rescue children and bring them home safely.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone None None NoneNoneNone None None     President Ronald Reagan proclaimed May 25, 1983, the first National Missing Childrens Day to remember Etan Patz, a six-year-old boy who disappeared from a New York City street corner on May 25, 1979.  Missing Childrens Day honors his memory and the memories of children still missing.
