A federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, permanently barred three individuals from preparing tax returns for others and owning or operating a tax return preparation business, the Justice Department announced today.The civil injunction order, to which the defendants Shandon Allen, Tabitha Tunstall, and Shewanda Hamilton agreed, was signed by U.S. District Judge S. Thomas Anderson of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.The United States brought the civil injunction suit in October 2014, alleging that the defendants and their employees prepare fraudulent tax returns that cause their customers to incorrectly report their federal tax liabilities and underpay their taxes. According to the complaint, the defendants and their employees prepare federal tax returns on which they falsely claim the Earned Income Tax Credit,improper filing status, and bogus education credits. Additionally, the defendants and their employees allegedly improperly prepare tax returns using paystubs rather than W-2 forms, fabricate bogus W-2 forms and file tax returns without some customers consent while charging deceptive and unconscionable fees, according to the suit.NoneNone
