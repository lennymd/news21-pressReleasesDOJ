The Justice Department reached an agreement today resolving claims that 1st Class Staffing LLC, a staffing company based in Orem, Utah, discriminated against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).The departments investigation conducted by the Civil Rights Divisions Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC), found that 1st Class Staffings Fontana, California, office routinely requested that non-U.S. citizens, but not U.S. citizens, provide specific immigration documents to establish their authority to work. Under the INA, all workers, including non-U.S. citizens, must be allowed to choose whichever valid documentation they would like to present from the lists of acceptable documents to prove their work authorization. It is unlawful for an employer to limit an employees choice of documentation because of their citizenship, immigration status or national origin.Under the terms of the settlement agreement, 1st Class must pay for lost wages to the charging party whose complaint initiated the departments investigation; pay $17,600 in civil penalties to the United States; participate in department-provided training on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA and be subject to departmental monitoring.Employers must ensure that their human resources, hiring and recruitment staff understand and implement proper hiring practices to avoid violating anti-discrimination laws, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division. We commend 1st Class for its cooperation and commitment to removing unnecessary and unlawful employment barriers.NoneNoneApplicants or employees who believe they were subjected to: different documentary requirements based on their citizenship status, immigration status or national origin; or discrimination based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin in hiring, firing or recruitment or referral, should contact the worker hotline above for assistance.None
