Today, the Department of Justice announced a series of reforms at the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) designed to reduce recidivism and increase the likelihood of inmates safe and successful return to the community. These efforts include building a semi-autonomous school district within the federal prison system, reforming federal halfway houses, covering the cost of obtaining state-issued photo IDs for federal inmates prior to their release from custody and providing additional services for female inmates. Helping incarcerated individuals prepare for life after prison is not just sound public policy; it is a moral imperative, said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. These critical reforms will help give federal inmates the tools and assistance they need to successfully return home as productive, law-abiding members of society.
