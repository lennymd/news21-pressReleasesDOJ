The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi permanently barred Teresa Chism of Durant, Mississippi, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.According to the governments civil complaint, Chism, who operated her business as Lady T. Taxes, prepared federal income tax returns that fraudulently overstated her customers claims for refunds. She did so by claiming refundable credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and credits for education expenses, that her customers either were ineligible to receive, or were not entitled to receive in the amounts claimed on the returns, the complaint alleged. The complaint further alleged that Chism frequently fabricated Forms W-2 and submitted them with a tax return as evidence of a customers eligibility for the EITC.The United States alleged in the complaint that Chism prepared at least 2,845 returns since 2010. Audits of 220 returns prepared by Chism claiming the EITC and/or other refundable credits revealed that 98 percent of these returns claimed credits totaling more than $1 million that Chisms customers were not eligible to receive, according to the complaint.None
