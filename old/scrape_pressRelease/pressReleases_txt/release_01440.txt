The Attorney General, today, had a positive and productive conversation with the Jewish Community Centers and JCC Association of North America. The Department of Justice will not tolerate hate crimes against Jewish communities or the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs. JCCs continue to have strong partnerships with local and federal law enforcement and the Attorney General commends them for their responsiveness, efficiency, calm and competence in the face of those who would threaten these institutions and the millions of Americans who walk through their doors.
