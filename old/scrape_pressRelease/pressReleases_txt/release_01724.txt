NoneNoneNoneOur modernized IP Licensing Guidelines continue to apply an effects-based analysis that puts the focus on evaluating harm to competition, not on harm to any individual competitor, and support procompetitive intellectual property licensing that can promote innovation, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. The comments we received were helpful in completing this update and also serve more broadly to better our understanding of some of todays very complex antitrust issues that involve intellectual property rights.Today, the Commission reaffirms its commitment to an economically grounded approach to antitrust analysis of IP licensing, saidChairwoman Edith Ramirez of the FTC. A strong and competitive IP licensing system benefits consumers and fosters innovation, by helping to ensure that inventors realize an appropriate return on their investment.In response to the desire of some commenters for the guidelines to more specifically address additional IP licensing activities, the agencies reiterate that the flexible effects-based enforcement framework set forth in the IP Licensing Guidelines remains applicable to all IP licensing activities. In addition, the business community may consult the wide body of DOJ and FTC guidance available to the public  in the form of published agency reports, statements, speechesand enforcement decisions  which rely on this analytical framework and further illuminate each agencys analysis of a variety of conduct involving intellectual property, including standards-setting activities and the assertion of standards-essential patents.NoneAntitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property
