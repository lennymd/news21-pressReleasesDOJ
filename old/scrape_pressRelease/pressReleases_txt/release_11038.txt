  The Council of Ministers of Interior and Justice of the European Union today adopted a U.S.- EU and EU Member States Declaration on Counterterrorism. Below is a statement from Attorney General Eric Holder, who attended the EU/G6 Conference of Interior Ministers in Italy this past weekend, on the Declaration:  "The Councils adoption of this Declaration is a crucial step forward in our mutual fight against terrorism. I attended the Meeting of the EU/G6 Ministers of Interior in Italy last weekend, where we discussed this Declaration, and I welcome the EUs swift action following those discussions.  "This Declaration demonstrates our joint commitment to protect our citizens from terrorism consistent with our laws, our values and our commitment to individual privacy. Our work with our EU partners to protect the security of our citizens  including through programs such as the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program and the Passenger Name Record Agreement  is critical to the success of our counterterrorism efforts.  "I look forward to continuing to work with our EU partners on these important matters."
