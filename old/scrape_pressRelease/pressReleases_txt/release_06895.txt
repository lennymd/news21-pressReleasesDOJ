  Ash Grove Cement Company has agreed to pay a $2.5 million penalty and invest approximately $30 million in pollution control technology at its nine Portland cement manufacturing plants to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act, announced the Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).NoneNone  The settlement is part of EPAs national enforcement initiative to control harmful air pollution from the largest sources of emissions, including portland cement manufacturing facilities. This is also the first settlement with a cement manufacturer that requires injunctive relief and emission limits for PM. SO2 and NOx, two key pollutants emitted from cement plants, can harm human health and are significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze. These pollutants are converted in the air into fine particles of particulate matter that can cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, and premature death.  Eight states and one local agency have joined the United States in the settlement, including: Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.NoneNone  More about EPAs National Enforcement Initiatives: http://www.epa.gov/compliance/data/planning/initiatives/index.html
