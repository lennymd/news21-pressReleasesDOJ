None       Congress has authorized federal and Indian lands to be leased for the production of natural gas in exchange for the payment of royalties on the value of the gas that is produced.  Each month companies are required to report to the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) the amount of royalty that is due. This settlement resolves claims by the United States that the Shell defendants improperly deducted from royalty values the cost of boosting gas up to pipeline pressures, and improperly reported processed gas as unprocessed gas to reduce royalty payments.       In June 2003, Shell paid $56 million to settle claims that it knowingly underpaid royalties related to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced from federal lands located in the Gulf of Mexico. Todays settlement resolves claims related to Shells on-shore federal leases.
