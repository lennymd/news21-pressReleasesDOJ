None  Our office takes these violations very seriously, said Logan Gregory, Special Agent in Charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Law Enforcement's Northeast Division. This type of illegal activity has a ripple effect on seafood markets and impacts fishing communities by driving down the price of fluke which reduces the potential profits of fishermen and dealers who abide by the regulations. We hope the outcome of this case deters others from coming up with similar schemes to circumvent federal fisheries laws and regulations and from gaining an unfair advantage over those who comply with the regulations.NoneNoneNone
