  Charles Brown, 54, of Mesa, Ariz., was sentenced today to five years in prison and lifetime supervised release following his prison term for receiving child pornography.  Brown was indicted on May 8, 2008, on charges of receipt and possession of child pornography. The charges arose after Brown responded to an advertisement offering child pornography videos that had been placed on the Internet by a U.S. Postal Inspector working undercover. After Brown selected and paid for a video, Postal Inspectors obtained an anticipatory search warrant. On the day that the video was delivered to Browns home, the inspectors executed the warrant and searched Browns computer, finding additional child pornography.  Brown pleaded guilty on March 10, 2009, to one count of receipt of child pornography. As part of the plea agreement, Brown admitted to ordering from the undercover inspector a video containing child pornography.NoneNone   The case was prosecuted by CEOS Trial Attorney James Silver, with assistance from Senior Litigation Counsel Vincent Q. Kirby and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon K. Sexton of the District of Arizona. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation.
