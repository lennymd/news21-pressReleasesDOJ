  Timothy S.  Miller, 58, a co-founder of a Chesapeake, Virginia, government contracting  company, pleaded guilty today to providing illegal gratuities to two public  officials working for the United States Navy Military Sealift Command.   Assistant  Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal  Division, United States Attorney Dana J. Boente of the Eastern District of  Virginia, Special Agent in Charge Robert Craig of the Defense Criminal  Investigative Service (DCIS) Mid-Atlantic Field Office, Special Agent in Charge  Susan Triesch of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Norfolk Field  Office, and Special Agent in Charge Royce  E. Curtin of the FBI Norfolk Field Office made the announcement today after  Millers guilty plea was accepted by United States Magistrate Judge Lawrence R.  Leonard of the Eastern District of Virginia.   According to  a statement of facts filed with the plea agreement, in February 2009, Miller,  along with his business partner, Dwayne A. Hardman, co-founded a government  contracting company that provided telecommunications support to the Military  Sealift Command, which is the leading provider of transportation for the U.S.  Navy.   At the plea  hearing, Miller admitted that he provided illegal gratuities to two officials at  the Military Sealift Command for  favorable official acts.   In particular,  he admitted that on May 12, 2009, he gave $30,000 in cash to Kenny E.  Toy, the former Afloat Programs Manager for the Military Sealift  Commands N6 Command, Control, Communication, and Computer Systems Directorate,  and Scott B. Miserendino Sr., a government contractor who worked with Toy at the  Military Sealift Command Headquarters.    He also admitted that just two days after giving Toy and Miserendino the  $30,000, he agreed that Hardman should give Toy and Miserendino an additional  $20,000.   According to  Millers statement of facts, Toy exercised substantial influence over the  Military Sealift Command contracting process by creating and executing  multi-million dollar budgets, obtaining funding for projects, developing and  having access to sensitive information, and requesting that subcontract work be  awarded to particular companies.   As a  result of the $50,000 payment, Miserendino and Toy performed various official  acts to assist Millers company.    Indeed, in 2009, Millers company received approximately $2.5 million in  business from the Military Sealift Command.   As a  condition of his plea agreement, Miller has agreed to forfeit $167,000.   Miller is scheduled to be sentenced on  November 7, 2014.   Earlier this  year, five other individuals pleaded guilty in connection with the bribery  scheme.   On February 12, 2014, Toy  pleaded guilty to bribery, and he was sentenced on July 29, 2014, to serve 96  months in prison and ordered to forfeit $100,000.
