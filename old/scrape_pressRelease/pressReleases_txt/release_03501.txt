NoneIn an effort to reduce barriers for justice-involved youth, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a new Juvenile Re-Entry Assistance Program: a $1.7 million initiative to help Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and legal assistance organizations address challenges to housing and employment among justice-involved individuals.None"The Department of Justice is committed to giving justice-involved youth the tools they need to become productive members of society," said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. "Providing meaningful support through housing opportunities, prevention programs and other critical services is vital to our ongoing efforts to reduce recidivism, promote public safety and foster positive results in communities across the country."Additionally, HUD announced updated public housing arrests guidance to PHAs regarding the use of arrests in determining who can live in HUD-assisted properties. The Guidance outlines that arrest records may not be the sole basis for denying admission, terminating assistance or evicting tenants; and reiterates that HUD does not require PHAs and owners to adopt One Strike policies and includes best practices and models of success from PHAs across the nation.HUD Secretary Julin Castro made these announcements today in Chicago as part of the Obama Administrations criminal justice and reentry incentive.Life is about second chances and offering young people an opportunity to turn away from their mistakes and get back on the right path, said Secretary Castro. These grants will allow Public Housing Authorities to help these young people to reach their potential and begin to contribute to their own communities.Having a juvenile or a criminal record can severely limit a persons ability to seek higher education, find good employment, or secure affordable housing. Today, there are nearly 55,000 individuals under age 21 in juvenile justice facilities. These consequences create unnecessary barriers to economic opportunity and productivity, and President Obama and members of his Cabinet continue to take impactful steps to ensure those exiting the justice system become productive, law-abiding citizens.
