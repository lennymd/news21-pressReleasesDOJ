  WASHINGTON  Michael D. Doyle, 41, of Woburn, Mass., was sentenced today to four years in prison for possessing images of child pornography, Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division Lanny A. Breuer, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Michael K. Loucks and Bruce M. Foucart, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Boston Field Office of the U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced.  Doyle also was sentenced to nine years of supervised release following his term in prison by U.S. District Court Judge George A. OToole Jr. The court accepted Doyles guilty plea to a one-count information charging possession of child pornography, which was filed on April 22, 2009.  This case was brought as part of a nationwide ICE investigation called "Operation Emissary," which targeted a Web site that offered images and movies of hardcore child pornography. The targeted Web site alerted would-be customers that subscribing to the site was illegal and warned them to be discreet about their purchases. Doyle admitted in his plea that he had subscribed to this Web site and possessed images and videos depicting prepubescent minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.None
