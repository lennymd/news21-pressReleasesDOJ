Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates released the following statement following President Obamas clemency announcement today:"The clemency initiative is about more than the 111 people who learned today that their sentences have been commuted; it's also about the families and communities who will welcome them home as they work to build a new life. With today's announcement, the President has given a second chance to over 300 individuals in the month of August and we expect many more men and women will receive that same opportunity in the months to come. We remain hopeful that Congress will come to a bipartisan and lasting solution for much needed sentencing reforms before the end of the year."
