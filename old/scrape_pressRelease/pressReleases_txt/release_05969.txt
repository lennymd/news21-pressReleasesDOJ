None  For 39 years, Marshall has distinguished himself in the Department as an exceptional public servant and a principled leader. To me, personally, he has been a trusted mentor and a good friend, said Attorney General Holder. In the face of daunting staff and resource constraints, Marshalls calm and steady leadership was exactly what EOUSA and the U.S. Attorney community needed over these past several years. His extraordinary contributions have left an indelible mark on the Department and the country will be forever grateful for his service.  Wilkinson, whose appointment as Director for EOUSA will become effective on March 31, has held many significant executive-level positions in the Department. He most recently served as the Principal Deputy Director and Chief of Staff for EOUSA. Before arriving at EOUSA, he served as Counselor and Deputy Chief of Staff to the Attorney General and as an Associate Deputy Attorney General.  Monty is a tremendous asset to the Department, and I am grateful he has agreed to take on this enormous responsibility, said Attorney General Holder. I look forward to continuing to work closely with him and the U.S. Attorneys as we continue our critical mission to provide justice for the American people.
