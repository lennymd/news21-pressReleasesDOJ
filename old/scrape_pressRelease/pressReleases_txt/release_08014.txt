A federal court has permanently barred a Michigan couple, Damian and Holly Jackson, of Detroit, from preparing federal tax returns for others, preparing their own federal tax returns using false 1099 forms, and promoting an alleged tax-fraud scheme based on the frivolous redemption theory, the Justice Department announced today. The civil injunction order, to which the Jacksons consented without admitting the allegations against them, was signed by Judge Paul D. Borman of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.NoneThe complaint alleged that Damian Jackson, a minister at the Perfecting Church in Detroit, prepared tax returns that claimed huge fraudulent refunds based on fabricated income-tax withholding reported on false IRS 1099 forms. According to the complaint, Holly Jackson transmitted the false 1099 forms to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The suit alleged that federal tax returns prepared for at least 182 customers under the auspices of Diamond Tax Services sought over $29 million in fraudulent refunds, and that the Jacksons own federal income tax returns have requested more than $2.5 million in bogus refunds. While most of these frivolous refund claims are intercepted by the IRS before refunds are issued, the complaint alleges that the defendants scheme has caused the IRS to issue at least $1.6 million in erroneous refunds to the defendants customers. According to the complaint, the Jacksons solicited up-front fees of $500 to $995 from customers, and received a 10 percent cut of any refund issued by the IRS.The injunction suit remains pending against a third defendant.NoneNoneNone
