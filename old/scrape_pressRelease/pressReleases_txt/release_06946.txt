  The Justice Department announced today that it will monitor municipal elections on June 4, 2013, in the cities of Brookhaven, Greenwood, Isola, Meridian, Philadelphia and Ruleville, Miss., to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Under the Voting Rights Act, the department is authorized to ask the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to send federal observers to jurisdictions that are certified by the Attorney General or by a federal court order. Federal observers will be assigned to monitor polling place activities in Greenwood, Isola, Philadelphia and Ruleville based on the Attorney Generals certification. The observers will watch and record activities during voting hours at polling locations, and Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate the federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.  In addition, department personnel will monitor polling place activities in Brookhaven and Meridian. Attorneys from the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division will coordinate federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.  Each year, the department deploys hundreds of federal observers from OPM, as well as departmental staff, to monitor elections across the country.
