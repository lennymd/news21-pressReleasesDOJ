  "We appreciate the diligent work of the National Research Councils committee on forensic science in preparing this report. The Department of Justices principal focus in dealing with forensic evidence is on applying it dispassionately to law enforcement challenges, and we regularly use forensics to not only convict the guilty, but also to exonerate the innocent.  "We look forward to working with the law enforcement community and members of Congress to evaluate this report and consider how best to address its findings and recommendations."
