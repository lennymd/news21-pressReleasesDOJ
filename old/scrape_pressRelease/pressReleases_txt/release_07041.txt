      The Justice Department announced today that it will monitor municipal elections on May 11, 2013, in the cities of Corrigan, Farmers Branch, Irving and Orange, Texas, to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The Voting Rights Act prohibits discrimination in the election process on the basis of race, color or membership in a minority language group.

Federal observers will be assigned to monitor polling place activities in Farmers Branch and Irving based on the attorney generals certification.  The observers will watch and record activities during voting hours at polling locations, and a Civil Rights Division attorney will coordinate the federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.       In addition, Justice Department personnel will monitor polling place activities in the cities of Corrigan and Orange.    Civil Rights Division attorneys will coordinate federal activities and maintain contact with local election officials.         Each year, the Justice Department deploys hundreds of federal observers from OPM, as well as departmental staff, to monitor elections across the country. To file complaints about discriminatory voting practices, including acts of harassment or intimidation, voters may call the Voting Section of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division at 1-800-253-3931.
