Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on recent police officer shootings:I am appalled and deeply saddened by the recent shooting attacks against law enforcement officers in Danville, Ohio, and Holladay, Utah, in addition to an earlier ambush in Philadelphia, which left an officer injured. These heinous assaults are reminders of the difficult jobs that our brave law enforcement officers perform every day and of the dangers that they willingly face in the service of their communities. The Department of Justice is dedicated to supporting the courageous men and women who wear the badge and determined to do all that we can to keep them safe. We stand ready to offer any and all appropriate resources to help hold accountable those who threaten our communities, attack our neighbors and seek to harm the peacekeepers within our nation.
