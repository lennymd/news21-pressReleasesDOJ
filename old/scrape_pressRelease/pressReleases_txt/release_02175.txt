WASHINGTON  Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on the departure, effective Oct. 15, 2016, of Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin:John Carlin has been a trusted and tireless leader of the Justice Departments National Security Division. He is wholly devoted to the department s most important mission  protecting our country against acts of terrorism and other national security threats  and he has set a high standard by relentlessly pursuing those who seek to harm our people and threaten our assets. For the better part of two decades at the Department of Justice, John distinguished himself as a leader who skillfully used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security. I have come to rely heavily on his sound judgment and clear vision as he handled some of the most challenging issues the department faced. He exemplifies the highest standards of excellence, integrity, and professionalism in public service.As Assistant Attorney General, John helped lead the departments response to terrorist threats ranging from the Boston Marathon bombing to the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. He oversaw the unprecedented indictment of five members of the Chinese military for cyber-enabled economic espionage and the investigation of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainments computer systems. And he forged crucial collaborations with our partners in the intelligence community, law enforcement, and the private sector, enhancing our collective ability to detect and deter threats as they arise.I thank John for his extraordinary service to the Department of Justice and to the nation, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
