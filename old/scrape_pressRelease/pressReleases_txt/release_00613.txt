A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia returned an indictment yesterday charging a former Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) official with a scheme to steal benefit money for veterans in need from the VA. Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departments Criminal Division made the announcement.  Russell M. Ware, 39, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was charged with four counts of wire fraud in connection with a scheme to steal more than $66,000 from the VA. Ware was also charged with one count of bribery and one count of theft of government property.  None An indictment is not a finding of guilt. It merely alleges that crimes have been committed. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The case is being investigated by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Richard B. Evans and Rebecca Moses of the Criminal Divisions Public Integrity Section.
