NoneNational Reentry Week Initiatives Aimed at Children of Incarcerated Parents and Enhancing Communication and Coordination Between Inmates and Family MembersAs part of National Reentry Week, Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates today announced several family-friendly initiatives aimed at strengthening the bonds between inmates and their children and families. The Deputy Attorney General also announced the launch of a new reentry hotline for returning citizens seeking help navigating life outside prison.The announcement was made following the Deputy Attorney Generals visit to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) female facility in Bryan, Texas, and a subsequent stop at Santa Maria Hostel, a residential reentry center for women in Houston.The family-friendly initiatives announced and highlighted by the Deputy Attorney General include expanding video-conferencing visitation; a pilot program that engages children of incarcerated parents in positive youth development activities; guidance and training for BOP staff on how to make visitation spaces more child friendly and interact with children in a developmentally appropriate way; educating inmates on how to keep in contact with children who may be in foster care; tip sheets for parents, correctional staff and mentors to support children of incarcerated parents; and a new interagency partnership to develop model policies that can be used by state and local prison facilities to help strengthen family ties.In addition to the departments efforts to promote family engagement, the Deputy Attorney General announced the launch of the first ever reentry hotline (18778959196) for individuals who have been released from federal custody and their families. The hotline, which opened this week, will aid returning citizens who need help finding government and private resources to aid their successful reentry. That includes help in determining how to get a copy of their birth certificate, where to start a job search and where to find legal aid service providers, among other crucial resources. The Deputy Attorney General toured the hotlines control center during her visit to the BOP facility in Bryan today. The hotline is staffed by female inmates working for Federal Prison Industries, BOPs largest reentry program.Assisting inmates in maintaining family relationships while they are in prison is not only good for the individuals returning from prison and their families, its good for the community as well, because when a person has a strong support system when they are released, they are less likely to re-offend, said Deputy Attorney General Yates. Doing everything we can to equip inmates to be successful when they leave prison, including assisting them in maintaining family relationships, is one of the most important things we can do for the safety of our communities.NoneThe BOP initiatives announced and highlighted by the Deputy Attorney General today include:The Deputy Attorney General also announced and highlighted three interagency initiatives developed to support incarcerated parents and their children:
