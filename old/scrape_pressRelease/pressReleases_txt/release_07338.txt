The Justice Department announced today that Texas Champion Bank of Alice, Texas, will establish uniform pricing policies, conduct employee training and pay $700,000 as part of a settlement to resolve allegations that it engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of national origin. None The complaint filed today demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to fair lending enforcement across the entire spectrum of credit markets, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We commend Texas Champion for working cooperatively with the Justice Department in reaching an appropriate resolution of this case. The lawsuit originated from a 2010 referral by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Texas Champion is a member of the FDIC. Under the settlement, Texas Champion will pay $700,000 to approximately 2,000 Hispanic victims of discrimination, monitor its loans for potential disparities based on national origin, and provide equal credit opportunity training to its employees. Texas Champion will also revise its pricing policies to ensure that the price charged for its loans is set in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with the requirements of ECOA. The agreement also prohibits the bank from discriminating on the basis of national origin in any aspect of a credit transaction. The Southern District of Texas is committed to ensuring banks and other lending institutions do not discriminate against borrowers on the basis of race or national origin, said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas Kenneth Magidson. The consent order filed today should serve as a reminder that discrimination in lending will not be tolerated. None None None
