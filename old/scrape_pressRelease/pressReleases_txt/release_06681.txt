U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky David J. Hale and Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Jocelyn Samuels announced that Steven Molen, a Sheriffs Deputy with the Pulaski County Sheriffs Office, was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on one count of violating the civil rights of a victim by using excessive force in August 2008. The indictment alleges that on Aug. 24, 2008, Molen assaulted a victim identified in the indictment as C.F., resulting in bodily injury. On June 27, 2013, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Kentucky indicted Molen on two other counts of violating the civil rights of different victims by using excessive force in 2009 and 2011. The investigation was conducted by the FBI. The cases against Molen will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Judd from the Western District of Kentucky, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pat Molloy and Ron Walker from the Eastern District of Kentucky, and Trial Attorney Ali Ahmad from the Civil Rights Division. The charges set forth in an indictment are merely accusations and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
