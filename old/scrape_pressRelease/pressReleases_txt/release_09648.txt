      WASHINGTON  Professional duck hunter and guide Jeffrey B. Foiles pleaded guilty today in federal court in Springfield, Ill., to wildlife charges arising from the illegal sale of guided waterfowl hunts, the Department of Justices Environment and Natural Resources Division announced today.       Foiles, 54, of Pleasant Hill, Ill., pleaded guilty to an information charging him with one misdemeanor count of unlawful sale of wildlife in violation of the Lacey Act, as well as one misdemeanor count of unlawfully taking migratory game birds in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  At the same time, the company that operates Foiles hunting club, the Fallin Skies Strait Meat Duck Club LLC, located in Pike County, Ill., pleaded guilty to an information charging it with one felony count of unlawful sale of wildlife in violation of the Lacey Act and one felony count of making false writings in a matter within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.     The Lacey Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly transport or sell wildlife taken in violation of federal law or regulation.  The act defines the sale of wildlife to include the sale of guiding services for the illegal taking of wildlife.     According to the plea agreements filed today, between 2003 and 2007, Foiles sold and guided waterfowl hunts at the club for the purpose of illegally hunting ducks and geese in excess of hunters individual daily bag limits.  Guided hunters paid $250 per day for hunts at the club.  Foiles and others at the club also falsified hunting records in order to conceal the excesses.         According to the plea agreements filed today, the government and the defendants have jointly asked the court to sentence Foiles to 13 months in prison, to be followed by one year of supervised release during which time he may not hunt or guide hunters, and to pay a $100,000 fine for which Fallin Skies Strait Meat Duck Club LLC agreed to serve as guarantor.  Further, Foiles agreed to one additional year, following completion of his term of supervised release, during which he will not hunt or guide.       The court must determine whether or not to accept the plea agreements.  If the plea agreements are accepted by the court, the government has agreed to dismiss the pending felony indictment against Foiles.       The sentencing hearing for Foiles is currently set for Sept. 21, 2011, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Byron G. Cudmore.  The sentencing hearing for Fallin Skies Strait Meat Duck Club LLC is scheduled for Oct. 27, 2011, before U.S. District Judge Richard Mills.        The case was investigated by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and the government of Canada.  The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of Illinois and the Justice Departments Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural Resources Division.
