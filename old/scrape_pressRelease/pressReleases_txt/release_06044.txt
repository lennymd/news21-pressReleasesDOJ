None      Todays civil settlements demonstrate our continuing vigilance to ensure that those doing business with the government do not engage in anticompetitive conduct, said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Civil Division Stuart F. Delery.  Government contractors who seek to profit at the expense of taxpayers will face serious consequences.          The government alleged that former executives of the defendant ocean shippers used personal email accounts to communicate confidential bidding information, thereby enabling each of the shippers to know the transportation rates that its competitor intended to submit to federal agencies for specific routes.  This information allowed the shippers to allocate specific routes between themselves at predetermined rates.   Among the contracts affected were U.S. Postal Service contracts to transport mail and Department of Agriculture contracts to ship food.  Both Sea Star Line and Horizon Lines previously pleaded guilty, in related criminal proceedings, to anticompetitive conduct in violation of the Sherman Act.         Postal Service contractors must understand and know that actions that undermine the contracting process, such as conspiring to suppress and eliminate competition, will not be tolerated and will be aggressively investigated, said Tom Frost, Special Agent in Charge of the Major Fraud Investigations Division (MFID) with the Postal Service Office of Inspector General.   MFID will continue to work with DOJ, both criminally and civilly, to bring those individuals and companies to justice. None       The settlements were the result of a coordinated effort by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General.   None
