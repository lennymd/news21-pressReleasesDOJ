  WASHINGTON  The Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today an agreement with over three dozen companies and government agencies that will result in a $56.4 million cleanup of the Malone Services Company Superfund Site in Texas City, Texas, a former waste-disposal site near the shore of Galveston Bay.   Cleanup under todays settlement will address the threat from more than a quarter of a million cubic yards of contamination left behind by the site operators in tanks and in a large unlined earthen basin, said Robert Dreher, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Departments Environment and Natural Resources Division. Through this agreement, the parties have avoided costly and time-consuming litigation and expedited a cleanup that will protect the health and safety of citizens of Texas City and the coastal environment along Swan Lake.NoneNone   The Malone Service Company operated a disposal facility for waste oil and waste chemicals between approximately 1964 and 1996. Hundreds of entities sent a total of approximately 481 million gallons of waste to the Site. Approximately 260,000 cubic yards of contaminated oily sludge is present in above-ground storage tanks and a multi-acre earthen impoundment. The consent decree requires that the oily sludge be solidified and placed into an on-site RCRA-Subtitle C-equivalent cell, along with contaminated soil. The groundwater will be monitored to confirm that the remedial action is preventing offsite migration. None
