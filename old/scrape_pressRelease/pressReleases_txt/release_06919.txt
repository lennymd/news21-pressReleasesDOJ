The Justice Department announced today that it has entered into a consent decree with the town of Griffith, Ind. that, if approved by the court, will resolve allegations that the Griffith Police Department discriminated against Sergeant Marlene Starcevich based on her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, or religion and retaliation for engaging in protected activity.The departments complaint was filed today along with a notice informing the court of the simultaneous filing of a consent decree to resolve the complaint. The complaint alleges that the Griffith Police Department violated Title VII when it failed to assign Starcevich to a shift commander position because of her sex. Starcevich is a 22-year veteran of the Griffith Police Department and the only female officer in the police departments history. According to the complaint, while the Griffith Police Department routinely assigned its male sergeants to shift commander positions, when a shift commander position became available in July 2010, Griffith denied Starcevich the position because of her sex.NoneGender discrimination in employment of any kind will not be tolerated, said Jocelyn Samuels, Principal Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division. This lawsuit should send a clear message that the department is committed to eliminating and remedying all forms of gender discrimination in the work place and that we will take necessary action to vigorously protect the rights of those in the public sector facing discrimination.Additional information about Title VII can be found on the Justice Department website, www.justice.gov/crt/emp , as well as on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions website at www.eeoc.gov.
