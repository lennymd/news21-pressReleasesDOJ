The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with the State of Vermont to help ensure that military service members, their family members and U.S. citizens living overseas have the opportunity to participate fully in the Nov. 6, 2012, federal general election. None This agreement reflects this departments steadfast and continued commitment to ensure that members of our armed forces, their families and overseas citizens are offered a full and meaningful opportunity to vote in our nations elections, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. I am most appreciative that election officials in Vermont worked cooperatively with the department and agreed to take actions to ensure that military and overseas voters will have a full opportunity to have their votes counted in the upcoming general election. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, said U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont Tristram J. Coffin. I am happy that we could resolve this issue in a manner that enables members of our armed services, and other citizens abroad, to exercise this fundamental right. None
