The Justice Department reached a comprehensive settlement agreement today with the California Department of Education (CDE) and the California State Board of Education to improve their compliance monitoring systems and ensure language instruction services to the approximately 1.4 million English Learner (EL) students in the states public schools.The settlement resolves the departments May 2015 findings that Californias system for monitoring its public schools provision of language services to EL students did not satisfy the states obligations under the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA) of 1974. The state cooperated fully during the review.The department concluded that the state had failed to respond appropriately to schools certified reports showing that over 20,000 EL students were not receiving instructional language services each school year since 2007 to 2008. The two-year agreement requires the state to undertake several actions, including:We applaud the state of California for working cooperatively with the Justice Department to ensure that all English Learner students can access the language services they need to learn, said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. We look forward to working with state officials to implement this important agreement and ensure full compliance in the months ahead.NoneNoneNone
