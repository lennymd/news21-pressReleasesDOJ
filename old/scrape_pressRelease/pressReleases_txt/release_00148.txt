A Pompano Beach, Florida, resident was sentenced today to 90 months in prison for filing fraudulent tax returns, wire fraud, and filing false monthly reports with the U.S. Probation Office announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg for the Southern District of Florida. According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Timothy J. Beverley, 61, worked as an airplane broker at Majestic Jet Inc., a company in Pompano Beach that provided aircraft charters. From 2010 through 2013, Beverly stole more than $2.2 million from Majestic Jet by directing airplane escrow agents to wire funds from the sale of planes to nominee bank accounts that Beverly controlled. Beverly also stole funds directly from Majestics business bank accounts and used the money to pay for personal expenses including his boat and rent. Beverley did not report this income on his 2010 through 2013 personal tax returns. The trial evidence further revealed that while working at Majestic Jet, Beverley was on supervised release stemming from his federal conviction for money laundering in January 2004. As a condition of his supervised release, Beverley was required to file monthly reports with the U.S. Probation Office that listed his net earnings from employment. Between November 2009 through October 2012, Beverley did not disclose the money he stole from Majestic Jet on his filed reports. In addition to the term of imprisonment, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom ordered Beverley to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution in the amount of $634,906. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and U.S. Attorney Greenberg commended the special agents of Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. This case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Neil Karadbil of the U.S. Attorneys Office and Assistant Chief Greg Tortella of the Tax Division. None
