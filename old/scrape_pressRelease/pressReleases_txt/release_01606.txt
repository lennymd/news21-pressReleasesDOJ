Two Philadelphia, Pennsylvania men pleaded guilty to conspiring to file federal tax returns using stolen IDs, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Louis D. Lappen for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. According to the indictment and information presented to the court, Moise Olivier, 27, and Hans Pierre, 28, opened bank accounts in the names of Moise Olivier Tax Service and Hans Pierre Tax Service even though neither had a tax service. Using stolen personal ID information, members of the conspiracy electronically filed returns seeking fraudulent refunds and directed that the refunds be deposited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into the Moise Olivier and Hans Pierre Tax Service bank accounts. Olivier and Pierre withdrew cash from the accounts to provide to other co-conspirators. Olivier admitted to causing a tax loss of $181,805.10. Pierre admitted to causing a tax loss of $95,157.41. Olivier is scheduled to be sentenced on May 2, and Pierre, who pleaded guilty on Feb. 8, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 27, before U.S. District Court Judge John R. Padova. Both face statutory maximum sentences of 10 years in prison, a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and Acting U.S. Attorney Lappen commended special agents of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the FBI, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney David Ignall and Trial Attorney Eric B. Powers of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case. None
