  WASHINGTON  The government has intervened in a lawsuit against Kellogg Brown & Root Services Inc. (KBR) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, announced the Department of Justice. The lawsuit was filed in February 2007 by James A. Brady III, a former employee of KBR, and alleges that KBR violated the False Claims Act in connection with "LOGCAP III," the third generation of the U.S. Armys Logistics Civil Augmentation Program awarded and administered at Rock Island, Ill. Under the contract, KBR was to provide logistics and sustainment support to U.S. military troops in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. KBR performed LOGCAP III largely through subcontractors.  According to the complaint, KBR entered into a subcontract with the Turkish company Yuksel-Reysas to do operations and maintenance work at Army camps near Mosul, Iraq. Brady alleges that KBR violated the False Claims Act because it was unable to account for materials paid for under the Yuksel-Reysas subcontract.  "Contractors hired to provide support to our men and women in uniform must play by the rules," said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. "As weve done today, the Justice Department will take action against those whom we believe charge the taxpayers for goods and services that were not provided to American troops."  "Weve decided to pursue the allegation that money that was intended to support the troops was instead used to pay claims that were false," said Jim Lewis, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois.None
