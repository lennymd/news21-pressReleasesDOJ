Ott admitted that he frequently paid for schooling and provided other financial support, including housing, for minors with whom he engaged in illicit conduct.  Ott has been in federal custody since he was arrested in December 2012, following his deportation from Tanzania. Engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Otts sentencing has been scheduled for July 26, 2013.
