None       According to a criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York, Sachakov is charged with one count of health care fraud.  He made his initial appearance today before Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold.        According to the complaint, Sachakov is a medical doctor, specializing in colo-rectal surgery.  The complaint alleges that from February 2009 to January 2010, Sachakov defrauded Medicare and other health care benefit programs by billing for services and surgeries that were never provided.  According to court documents, several health care benefit programs began investigating Sachakov after receiving complaints from patients about claims submitted by Sachakov for services that they did not receive and/or suspicious billing patterns.  The HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services initiated an investigation based on Sachakovs pattern of billing for multiple hemorrhoidectomies (a procedure to remove hemorroids), office visits and examinations on the same day for the same patient on multiple occasions.  According to court documents, Sachakov consistently submitted claims for office visits, examinations and subsequent hemorrhoidectomies as if he were treating distinct, unrelated conditions, when, in fact, he was providing follow up services related to the initial procedure.  The complaint also alleges that Sachakov submitted claims for services and surgeries not rendered or performed.       Sachakov faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  A complaint merely contains charges and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.None      This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Steven Kim of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Katz, on detail to the Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Duncan Levin of the Eastern District of New York.
