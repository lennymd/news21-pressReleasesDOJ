  WASHINGTON  SunTrust Mortgage Inc., the mortgage lending subsidiary of the nations 11th-largest commercial bank, has agreed to pay $21 million to resolve a lawsuit by the Department of Justice that it engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination that increased loan prices for many of the qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers who obtained loans between 2005 and 2009 through SunTrust Mortgages regional retail offices and national network of mortgage brokers.NoneNone  The settlement was filed in conjunction with the departments complaint that alleges SunTrust Mortgage violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by charging more than 20,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher fees and interest rates than non-Hispanic white borrowers, not based on borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin. Specifically, the allegations involve loans made to African-American borrowers between 2005 and 2008 through the more than 200 retail offices directly operated by SunTrust Mortgage in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic portions of the United States. The allegations also involve loans made to African-American and Hispanic borrowers between 2005 and 2009 through SunTrust Mortgages national network of mortgage brokers.  Racial and ethnic bias have no place in the lending market, said Neil H. MacBride, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. We are pleased that SunTrust Mortgage is taking steps to compensate the victims and to ensure fair and equal access to credit in the future.  SunTrust Mortgages business practice during the time periods covered by the lawsuit allowed its loan officers and mortgage brokers to vary a loans interest rate and other fees from the price it set based on the borrowers objective credit-related factors. This subjective and unguided pricing discretion resulted in African-American and Hispanic borrowers paying more.  Prior to the settlement, SunTrust Mortgage had implemented policies that substantially reduced the discretion of its loan officers and mortgage brokers to vary a loans interest rate and other fees from the price it set based on the borrowers objective credit-related factors, and that required the reasons for variations to be documented and reviewed by a supervisor. Those policies, operating in concert with rules imposed by the Federal Reserve in April 2011 and incorporated into the settlement, restrict compensating loan officers and mortgage brokers based on the terms or conditions of a particular loan. Todays settlement requires SunTrust Mortgage to keep its improved policies in place for at least the next three years, as well as continuing to monitor its lending for signs of discrimination and providing monitoring reports to the United States.  The departments investigation into SunTrust Mortgages lending practices began after a referral by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division in December 2009 for potential patterns or practices of discrimination. SunTrust Mortgages parent company, Atlanta-based SunTrust Bank, is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and one of the nations largest regional banks with $178 billion in assets and more than 1,600 branches in seven states and the District of Columbia.  Racial or other illegal discrimination has no place in our credit markets, said Federal Reserve Board Governor Elizabeth A. Duke. We are pleased that this settlement is designed to ensure fair access to credit.NoneNoneNoneNone
