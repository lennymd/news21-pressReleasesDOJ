  Attorney General Eric Holder announced today that President Obamas FY 2014 Budget proposal totaling $27.6 billion for the Department of Justice identifies over $561.4 million in efficiencies, savings and rescissions while providing resources to increase critical national security programs, and uphold the departments traditional missions with an increased focus on gun safety, cyber security, financial and mortgage fraud, immigration laws, civil rights, prisons and detention capacity, and assistance for our state, local and tribal law enforcement partners. Although sequestration cut over $1.6billion from the departments budget in FY2013 and creates countless operational challenges, the Presidents budget replaces and repeals joint committee enforcement and provides for the departments key priorities.   The request represents a 3percent increase in budget authority from the FY 2012 enacted level.  The Presidents budget request reflects a strong commitment to building upon the record of progress we have established in fulfilling the Justice Departments most critical missions. The proposed budget will provide the department with the resources necessary to protect the American people from terrorism and other national security threats; to prevent and respond to violent crime; to enforce the civil rights to which everyone in this country is entitled; to protect the most vulnerable among us; to combat financial and mortgage fraud; and to work alongside key state, local and tribal law enforcement partners in achieving the goals we share, said Attorney General Holder. As in previous years, this budget incorporates department-wide savings and efficiencies, but the need for a balanced, bipartisan deficit reduction plan remains an urgent priority. And it is imperative that we eliminate current fiscal uncertainty and ensure that these critical enhancements can be implemented.

The FY 2014 budget request provides a total of $4.4billion to maintain critical counterterrorism and counterintelligence programs and sustain recent increases for intelligence gathering and surveillance capabilities.  The Administration supports critical national security programs within the Department, including those led by the FBI and the National Security Division (NSD).   In FY 2012, the FBI dedicated approximately 4,200 agents to investigate more than 33,000 national security cases.   NSD has continued to carry out its primary functions to prevent acts of terrorism and espionage in the United States and to facilitate the collection of information regarding the activities of foreign agents and powers.     In FY 2014, the department is investing $14 million to improve intelligence coordination and collection, expand information sharing efforts, and strengthen investigations of national security efforts in order to protect the nation and secure the homeland.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
