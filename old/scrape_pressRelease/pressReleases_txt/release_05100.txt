Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., an automotive parts manufacturer based in Kariya, Japan, has agreed to plead guilty and to pay a $35.8 million criminal fine for its role in a conspiracy to allocate customers of variable valve timing (VVT) devices sold to automobile manufacturers in the United States and elsewhere, the Department of Justice announced today.NoneTodays charge continues the Antitrust Divisions ongoing campaign to hold automobile part suppliers accountable for their illegal collusive conduct, said Brent Snyder, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Divisions criminal enforcement program. The division continues to vigorously prosecute companies and individuals that seek to maximize their profits through illegal, anticompetitive means.NoneVVT devices are installed in automobile engines and regulate the timing, extent, and duration of the opening of the engines intake and exhaust valves, thereby increasing fuel economy and engine performance. Including Aisin, 31 companies and 44 individuals have been charged in the Justice Departments ongoing investigation into the automotive parts industry. All 31 companies have either pleaded guilty or have agreed to plead guilty and have agreed to pay more than $2.4 billion in criminal fines. Of the 44 individuals, 26 have been sentenced to serve time in U.S. prisons or have entered into plea agreements calling for significant prison sentences. Aisin is charged with allocating customers in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum penalty of a $100 million criminal fine for corporations. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.
