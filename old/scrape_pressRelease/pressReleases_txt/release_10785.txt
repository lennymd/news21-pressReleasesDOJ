      WASHINGTON   - A federal district judge in Atlanta has permanently barred Saloum A. Njie and his company, MIAAS Associates LLC, from preparing federal tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today.  The court also ordered the defendants to provide their customer lists to the government and to mail copies of the court order to their former clients.       The court found that in preparing federal tax returns to submit to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the defendants consistently understated their customers true tax liabilities based upon unreasonable positions that they knew or should have known were not supported by substantial authority. The defendants prepared customers' tax returns claiming either the earned income tax credit for customers who do not qualify for the credit, or overstating the credit amount to which customers are entitled.  Additionally, defendants have continued this unlawful practice despite three separate investigations by the IRS, each of which found numerous violations of federal tax law and resulted in thousands of dollars in monetary penalties.         Altogether, defendants activities may have resulted in more than $1 million in understated federal income tax liabilities for their customers, for returns prepared between 2006 and 2009.       Over the past decade, the Justice Departments Tax Division has obtained hundreds of injunctions to stop tax fraud promoters and dishonest tax return preparers.  Information about these cases is available on the Justice Department website.
