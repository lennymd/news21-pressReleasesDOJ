  A former senior executive of ArthroCare Corp., a publicly traded medical device company based in Austin, Texas, pleaded guilty for his role in a scheme to defraud the companys shareholders and members of the investing public by falsely inflating ArthroCares earnings, announced Acting Assistant Attorney Mythili Raman of the Department of Justices Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Robert Pitman of the Western District of Texas. The plea was taken under seal on June 24, 2013, and unsealed late yesterday.  John Raffle, 45, of Austin, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Lane in Austin to conspiracy to commit securities, mail and wire fraud and two false statements violations. Raffle was the senior vice president of Strategic Business Units at ArthroCare, overseeing all sales and marketing staff at the company. Raffle admitted that he and other co-conspirators falsely inflated ArthroCares sales and revenue through a series of end-of-quarter transactions involving ArthroCares distributors and that he and other co-conspirators caused ArthroCare to file a Form 10-K for 2007 and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2008 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that materially misrepresented ArthroCares quarterly and annual sales, revenues, expenses and earnings. As part of his plea, Raffle agreed that his conduct and the conduct of his co-conspirators caused more than $400 million in losses to shareholders.  According to court documents, Raffle and others determined the type and amount of product to be shipped to distributors  notably ArthroCares largest distributor, DiscoCare Inc.  based on ArthroCares need to meet sales forecasts, rather than the distributors actual orders. Raffle and others then caused ArthroCare to park millions of dollars worth of ArthroCares medical devices at its distributors at the end of each relevant quarter. ArthroCare would then report these shipments as sales in its quarterly and annual filings at the time of the shipment, enabling the company to meet or exceed internal and external earnings forecasts.  According to the superseding information, DiscoCare agreed to accept shipment of approximately $37 million of product in exchange for substantial, upfront cash commissions, extended payment terms and the ability to return product, as well as other special conditions, allowing ArthroCare to falsely inflate its revenue by tens of millions of dollars. To conceal the fact that DiscoCare owed ArthroCare a substantial amount of money on the unused inventory, Raffle and others caused ArthroCare to acquire DiscoCare on Dec. 31, 2007.  According to court documents, between December 2005 and December 2008, ArthroCares shareholders held more than 25 million shares of ArthroCare stock. On July 21, 2008, after ArthroCare announced publicly that it would be restating its previously reported financial results from the third quarter 2006 through the first quarter 2008 to reflect the results of an internal investigation, the price of ArthroCare shares dropped from $40.03 to $23.21 per share. The drop in ArthroCares share price caused an immediate loss in shareholder value of more than $400 million.  Raffle faces a maximum prison sentence of five years in prison for each charge. A sentencing date has yet to be scheduled. Raffles co-defendant David Applegate pleaded guilty on May 9, 2013. ArthroCares Chief Executive Officer, Michael Baker, and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Gluk, were indicted as part of the same alleged securities fraud scheme on July 16, 2013. An indictment is merely a charge, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  This case was investigated by the FBIs Austin office. The case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Benjamin D. Singer and Trial Attorneys Henry P. Van Dyck and William Chang of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section. The Department recognizes the substantial assistance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
