WASHINGTON  Daniel Melgoza, a Bexar County, Texas, Corrections Officer, was charged today in a four-count federal indictment with violating the civil rights of two detainees and obstructing justice. The charges stem from two December 2004 incidents in which Melgoza, 54, of San Antonio, allegedly assaulted inmates at the Bexar County Detention Center by kicking and striking them. The indictment also charges Melgoza with obstructing justice by providing false statements about the assaults.An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.If convicted, the defendant faces maximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment on each of the civil rights charges and 20 years imprisonment on each of the obstruction charges.This case was investigated by Special Agent Mirella Rodriguez of the San Antonio Division of the FBI with assistance from the Bexar County Sheriffs Offiice, and is being prosecuted by Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Christopher Lomax and Special Litigation Counsel Jeffrey Blumberg.
