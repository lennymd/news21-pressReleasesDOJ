The Justice Department announced today that it has reached a settlement agreement with Ark Rustic Inn LLC d/b/a Rustic Inn Crabhouse (Rustic Inn), a restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The agreement resolves the departments investigation into whether Rustic Inn discriminated against work-authorized immigrants when verifying their employment authorization, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  The departments investigation revealed that Rustic Inn routinely requested that work-authorized non-U.S. citizens present specific documents, such as Permanent Resident Cards or Employment Authorization Documents, to verify their citizenship status information, but did not subject U.S. citizens to such verification. The anti-discrimination provision of the INA prohibits employers from subjecting employees to different or unnecessary documentary demands based on employees citizenship, immigration status or national origin. Under the settlement, Rustic Inn will pay a civil penalty to the United States, train its staff, post notices informing workers about their rights under the INAs anti-discrimination provision, and be subject to departmental monitoring for three years. Employers, large and small, must be aware of their legal obligations to avoid imposing barriers to employment based on citizenship status or national origin, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John M. Gore of the Civil Rights Division. We commend Rustic Inn for its cooperation throughout this investigation and its commitment to ensure compliance with the law.
