    WASHINGTON - Taleo Corp. has agreed to pay the United States $6.49 million to resolve allegations that it knowingly caused false claims to be submitted to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Justice Department announced today.     In 2002, CPS Human Resource Services contracted with TSA to perform human resource services. Taleo, which is based in Dublin, Calif., subcontracted with CPS to provide supporting software. Taleos subcontract stated that Taleo would charge its commercial list rates with certain discounts.      The United States alleged that Taleo's commercial list rates were usually based on a customer's actual number of employees, but that Taleo charged TSA a higher rate that was not based on the agency's actual number of employees. If Taleo had followed the normal procedure, the rate TSA was charged would have been lower.     Those who do business with federal agencies must be honest and play by the rules, said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice.We are committed to protecting taxpayer dollars by pursuing contractors who overcharge the government.
