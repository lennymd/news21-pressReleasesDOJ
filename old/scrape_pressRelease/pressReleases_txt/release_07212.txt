    The Justice Department   announced today that it reached an agreement with   Poulan Pecan,   resolving allegations that the company violated the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  Poulan Pecan is a supplier of pecans located in Poulan, Ga.       The Justice Departments Civil Rights Division initiated its investigation of Poulan Pecan in 2012, based on a claim by an individual who called a department hotline and complained that the pecan-producing company requested specific documentation from her to establish her work authorization.  The departments investigation concluded that Poulan Pecan discriminated against work-authorized non-U.S. citizens by requiring specific and more documents than necessary from them when completing the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, while not imposing similar requirements of U.S. citizens.       Under the terms of the agreement, Poulan Pecan will pay $500 in civil penalties and be subject to monitoring of its employment eligibility verification practices for a period of one year.  Designated Poulan Pecan officials have already completed training by the Justice Department on the anti-discrimination provision of the INA.  The case settled prior to the Justice Department filing a complaint in this matter.     Individuals should be treated equally during the employment eligibility verification process, said Gregory Friel, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. This means not placing additional requirements, documentary or otherwise, on individuals based on their citizenship status.  None
