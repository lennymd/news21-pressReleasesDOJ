NoneNoneAs a retired police chief with close to 30 years in the field, I believe the lessons learned from this publication serve as a stark reminder of the need to ensure victims of sexual assault and domestic violence are not further victimized by gender bias  whether intentional or implicit, said COPS Office Director Ronald Davis. I recommend that every law enforcement executive read this report.The publication provides recommendations from law enforcement officers and executives, victim advocates, academics, and subject matter experts who attended the August roundtable, and shared insights on improving law enforcement response to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, particularly amongst vulnerable populations such as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community; racial, cultural and religious minorities; and immigrants.The publication recommends:Addressing gender bias in agency culture through officer training and accountability;Developing clear policies, resources, and partnerships; andApplying a survivor-centered approach.None
