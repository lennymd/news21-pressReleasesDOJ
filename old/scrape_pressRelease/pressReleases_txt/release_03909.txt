A Troy, Alabama, man was sentenced to prison today in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama for his involvement in a stolen identity tax refund fraud scheme, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Department of Justices Tax Division and U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr. of the Middle District of Alabama. Devon Tucker, 31, a former jailer of the Troy Police Department at the city jail, pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of aggravated identity theft. U.S. District Judge Callie V.S. Granade sentenced Tucker to serve 32 months in prison and three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay $13,162 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to court documents, from January 2014 to January 2015, Tucker stole the personal identification information of approximately 150 individuals who were processed into the Troy city jail. Tucker provided those identities to his co-conspirators for the purpose of filing false federal income tax returns claiming fraudulent refunds from the U.S. Treasury. Tucker was paid in pre-paid debit cards in the names of the identity theft victims for his involvement in the scheme. NoneIt is always a sad day when a law enforcement officer sworn to uphold the law, takes advantage of his position for his own personal gain, stated U.S. Attorney Beck. This district will continue to vigorously prosecute those who steal identities and file fraudulent tax returns, regardless of where they are employed or what position they hold.Acting Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo and U.S. Attorney Beck commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Trial Attorneys Gregory P. Bailey and Michael P. Hatzimichalis of the Tax Division and Assistant U. S. Attorney Jonathan Ross of the Middle District of Alabama, who prosecuted this case.None
