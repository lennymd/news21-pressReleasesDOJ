The Justice Department announced that it has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the School District of Palm Beach County, Fla., the nations eleventh-largest school district, to prevent and address discrimination in school enrollment and student discipline. The agreement resolves the departments investigation into complaints that the district failed to enroll children based on their or their parents national origin or immigration status, and that its system of discipline discriminated against students based on national origin and limited English proficiency. The district serves more than 179,000 students, including 20,000 English language learners (ELLs). All children deserve an equal opportunity to learn, no matter where they are from or what language they speak, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. We commend the School District of Palm Beach County for working collaboratively with the department to remove barriers to student enrollment, and for taking strong action to promote a safe, inclusive school environment for all students. Under the agreement, the district will enroll all area students regardless of background and will provide translation and interpretation services throughout the registration process. The district will also limit the use of disciplinary measures that remove students from the classroom and implement behavior management and discipline practices that support and protect students.
