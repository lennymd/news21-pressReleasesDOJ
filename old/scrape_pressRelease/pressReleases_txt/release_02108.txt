Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch today released the following statement on the passing of Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson:With the passing of Kenneth Thompson, the United States has lost a tireless defender of equal rights and a steadfast champion of equal justice. Through our work together as federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, I came to know Ken as a devoted public servant. That determination was at the center of all his cases, including the prosecution of police officers for the assault upon Abner Louima, a case I had the privilege of working on alongside him. Ken leaves behind a proud legacy of integrity, selflessness and excellence. Our nation is a stronger and safer place because of his dedicated service. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. He will be truly missed.
