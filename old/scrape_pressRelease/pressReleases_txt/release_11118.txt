  WASHINGTON  The Justice Department announced that it has reached an agreement with Argosy University in Nashville, Tenn., and its parent company, Education Management Corporation (EDMC) of Pittsburgh, to settle allegations that Argosy refused to hire a lawful permanent resident because he is a non-United States citizen and intimidated him for reporting the schools refusal to hire.  Under the terms of the out-of-court settlement, Argosy and EDMC have agreed to provide full back pay of $7,100 to the lawful permanent resident, to modify their policy on employing foreign nationals to require equal treatment of work authorized non-citizens, and to train Argosy employees on federal protections for workers against citizenship status and national origin discrimination and retaliation.  "Our nations laws ensure that all individuals who are authorized to work in this country can do so without fear of discrimination or retaliation because of their citizenship status or national origin," said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. "The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that all authorized U.S. workers, regardless of citizenship or national origin, are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace."  The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) within the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division is responsible for enforcing the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which protects authorized U.S. workers from employment discrimination on the basis of citizenship status or national origin, and from retaliation.None
