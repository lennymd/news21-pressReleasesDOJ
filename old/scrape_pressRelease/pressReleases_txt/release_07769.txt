The Justice Department announced today that it reached a settlement with Mrs. Ks Tollhouse Restaurant of Silver Spring, Md., to remedy alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The agreement resolves allegations that the restaurant failed to remove architectural barriers that made parts of it inaccessible to people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. Under the settlement agreement, Mrs. Ks will make the interior of the restaurant, the exterior routes and the parking lots accessible to people with disabilities. Mrs. Ks will also install a new fully accessible restroom and retrofit an existing one. People with disabilities have the right to go to restaurants just like everyone else, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. The department is committed to ensuring that this civil right is upheld for all people with disabilities. The ADA requires public accommodations, including restaurants, to provide people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs, full and equal enjoyment of the public accommodations goods, services and facilities.
