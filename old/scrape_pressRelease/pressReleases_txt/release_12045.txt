This agreement is the 163rd entered into under Project Civic Access.  "Because of Gregg Countys willingness to work cooperatively toward this agreement, individuals with disabilities will now have greater access to those programs, services and facilities that so many of us take for granted," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "Civic access is a civil right, and I applaud county officials for their commitment to improving access."

The agreements are tailored for each community to address specific areas where access to a governments programs or facilities can be improved.None
