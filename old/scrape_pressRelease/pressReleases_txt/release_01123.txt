Senior Judge Sue L. Robinson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today ruled in favor of the Justice Departments civil antitrust lawsuit to block radioactive waste disposal provider EnergySolutions $367 million acquisition of rival Waste Control Specialists. Judge Robinson entered an order ruling in favor of the United States and enjoining the merger.Substantial evidence showed that head-to-head competition between EnergySolutions and Waste Control Specialists led to better disposal services at lower prices, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Andrew Finch of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. Todays decision protects competition in an industry that is incredibly difficult to enter. While EnergySolutions preference was to buy its main rival rather than continue to compete to win business, todays decision ensures that customers will benefit from the competitive process.The Courts decision follows a 10-day trial that concluded in May. The Justice Department filed suit in November 2016, alleging that the proposed acquisition would combine the two most significant competitors for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste available to commercial customers in 36 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
