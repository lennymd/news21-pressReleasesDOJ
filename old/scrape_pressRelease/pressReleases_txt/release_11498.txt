  A State Department employee was sentenced today to 12 months of probation forillegally accessing 70 confidential passport application files, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. Susan Holloman, 58, of Washington, D.C., wasalso ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Kay in the District ofColumbia to perform 75 hours of community service. On Nov. 9, 2009, Holloman pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information charging her with unauthorized computer access.  According to court documents, Holloman has worked full-time for the State Department since November 1980, as a fileassistant within the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Inpleading guilty, Holloman admitted that shehad access to official State Department computer databases in the regular course of her employment, including the Passport Information Electronic Records System (PIERS), which contains all imaged passport applications dating back to 1994. The imaged passport applications on PIERS contain, among other things, a photograph of the passport applicant as well as certain personal information including the applicants full name, date and place of birth, current address, telephone numbers, parent information, spouses name and emergency contact information. These confidential files are protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, and access by State Department employees is strictly limited to official government duties.  In pleading guilty, Holloman admitted that between Feb. 13 and Dec. 5, 2007, she logged onto the PIERS database and repeatedly searched for and viewed the passport applications of 70celebrities and their families, actors, professional athletes, musicians and other individuals identified in the press. Holloman admitted that she had no official government reason to access and view these passport applications, but that her sole purpose in accessing and viewing these passport applications was idle curiosity.
