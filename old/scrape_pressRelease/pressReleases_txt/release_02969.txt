Williams and Clark were jointly ordered to pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $601,780. In November 2015, both Williams and Clark pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States. Clark also pleaded guilty to an additional conspiracy charge connected to another scheme for which she was indicted in May 2015.According to court documents and statements in court, in early 2011, Williams and Clark established a trust that purported to be for charitable purposes and then filed tax returns in the name of the trust for tax years 2008, 2009 and 2010.
