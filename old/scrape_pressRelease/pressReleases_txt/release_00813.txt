None Gregory Jerome Lee, 54, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, pleaded guilty in January 2017 to four counts of production of child pornography. U.S. District Judge Virginia Emerson Hopkins presided over the sentencing in Birmingham, Alabama. According to court documents, beginning in September 1996 and continuing for over a decade, until August of 2007, Lee and his co-conspirators belonged to a group of sophisticated offenders who gathered in secret, password-protected, chat rooms to discuss their sexual interest in minors and the real-life sexual abuse of children being perpetrated by several group members. Lee and others also used these chat rooms to advertise, distribute, receive, and possess child pornography. Court documents state that from September of 1996 through December of 2004, Lee sexually abused at least seven different minors and that he frequently produced images and videos depicting his sexual exploitation of these children which he shared with his co-conspirators.  Trial Attorney Ralph Paradiso of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) of the Justice Departments Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Fortune of the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case.
