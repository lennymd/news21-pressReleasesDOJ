  Attorney General Eric Holder announced today that President Obamas FY 2013 Budget proposal totaling $27.1 billion for the Department of Justice identifies over $1 billion in efficiencies, savings and rescissions while providing resources to sustain critical national security programs, uphold the departments traditional missions with an increased focus on financial and mortgage fraud and civil rights enforcement, invest in prisons and detention capacity, and assist our state, local and tribal law enforcement partners. The request represents a 0.4percent decrease in budget authority from the FY 2012 enacted level.     The Presidents Budget request will provide the department with the resources necessary to continue protecting the American people from terrorism and other urgent threats to our national security. It will enable us to safeguard citizens from violent crime and threats to the most vulnerable among us.And it will strengthen critical efforts to combat financial and mortgage fraud, while recognizing the valuable role of state, local and tribal law enforcement partners in achieving national goals, said Attorney General Holder. As in previous years, this budget incorporates department-wide savings and efficiencies while identifying new ways to cut costs without affecting our core missions.None  The Department of Justices key priorities include:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone None   Defending national security from both internal and external threats remains the Department of Justices highest priority.   The FY 2013 Budget request provides a total of $4billion to maintain critical counterterrorism and counterintelligence programs and sustain recent increases for intelligence gathering and surveillance capabilities.  The administration supports critical national security programs within the department, including those led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Division (NSD).   In FY 2011, the FBI dedicated approximately 4,200 agents to investigate more than 33,000 national security cases.   NSD has continued to carry out its primary functions to prevent acts of terrorism and espionage in the United States and to facilitate the collection of information regarding the activities of foreign agents and powers.     Investigating cybercrime and protecting our nations critical network infrastructure is a top priority of the department.   The Presidents FY 2013 Budget request maintains recent increases for the FBIs cyber terrorism investigations, the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) and the forensic examination of digital evidence.   In addition, other department components have made critical investments to protect U.S. citizens and secure our homeland, and these components will continue their efforts in FY 2013.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone  The FY 2013 Budget streamlines programs and redirects funding to improve the capabilities of the department.   As such, the budget proposes over $1 billion in efficiencies, offsets, redirections of grant program funding and rescissions.   Excluding the redirection of grant program funding, the budget includes $647 million in savings, program and management offsets and one-time rescissions of prior year balances to support our highest priority missions.  Savings and efficiencies include information technology savings, space reductions, administrative efficiencies, overhead reductions and operational efficiencies.   The department also proposes to consolidate and realign components to increase efficiencies, including refocusing and realigning the National Drug Intelligence Center functions into the Drug Enforcement Administration. In addition, the budget proposes to merge the detention functions currently performed by the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee into the U.S. Marshals Service to better align detention resources with operations, simplify the financial process supporting detention housing and reduce administrative costs.   In addition to department-wide initiatives, component-unique program savings have been identified, including expanding BOPs compassionate release to inmates with medical conditions that have served at least two-thirds of their sentence (excluding those sentences for violent or sex offenses) and implementing proposed legislation to make changes in the federal inmate good conduct time credit incentives.  The department has actively pursued savings and efficiencies in other areas consistent with the Presidents Campaign to Cut Waste and will continue to do so in FY 2013.   We have made significant efforts to limit and reduce spending in the areas of publication, travel, supplies, fleet, advisory contracts, promotional items and information technology devices to meet or exceed a reduction target of $146 million from FY 2010 levels.None
