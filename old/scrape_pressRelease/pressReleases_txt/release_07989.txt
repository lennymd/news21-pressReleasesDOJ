None The consent order, which the court approved without modifications, declared the school system unitary in all areas of its operation except for student assignment, which includes issues related to student discipline. To address the outstanding issues and achieve full unitary status, the school system agreed to immediately close one of its schools. Additionally, they are also required to address racial disparities in student discipline by adopting a revised student discipline policy, conduct a comprehensive training for all of its administrators, teachers and staff who are responsible for student discipline and adopt a process for monitoring student discipline data. We are pleased the court approved the consent order and that the West Carroll Parish School Board was willing to reach an agreement on this important case, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. We look forward to working closely with the school system as it continues to enact policies and practices that create a safe and inclusive environment for all students. None
