At his hearing, Joseph Oldani admitted that while on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, he stole high-grade optics from his station in Kings Bay, Ga. Timothy, Josephs brother, is a former member of the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. Joseph admitted he transported the stolen optics to Timothy, in Scott Depot, where Timothy subsequently sold the stolen items on the Internet  mainly on eBay.  The convictions stem from a joint investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General -- Defense Criminal Investigative Service and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  The stolen optics are not the type available for public purchase, but are specially designed for military purposes.
