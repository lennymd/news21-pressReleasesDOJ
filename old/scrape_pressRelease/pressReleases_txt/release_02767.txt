Civil and Criminal Enforcement Actions Are Taken Against Employers and Individuals Who Violate Employment Tax LawsWith the first quarterly employment tax returns of 2016 due April 30, the Justice Department reminds employers that they have a legal responsibility to collect and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes withheld from their employees wages. For employers and other responsible persons who fail to withhold, report, and pay employment taxes to the IRS, the Department is committed to enforcing federal employment tax laws through both civil litigation and criminal prosecutions.Employers Must Comply with Employment Tax LawsEmployers in the United States are required to collect, account for, and pay over to the IRS tax withheld from employee wages, including federal income tax and taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), including old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes, also known as social security taxes, and the hospital insurance tax, also known as Medicare taxes. Employers also have an independent responsibility to pay their matching portion of social security and Medicare taxes.Tax withheld from employee wages accounts for approximately 70 percent of annual revenue collected by the IRS. When last measured, underreported and unpaid employment taxes represented approximately $72 billion of the overall tax gap in the United States. As of September 2015, more than $59 billion of tax reported on employment tax returns remained unpaid.Employers who comply with our nations tax laws are entitled to a level playing field, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Justice Departments Tax Division. Those individuals and entities that fail to withhold employment tax, or withhold and fail to pay employment taxes over to the IRS, not only steal from their employees and the U.S. Treasury, but gain an unfair competitive advantage over businesses down the street and across the country. The Department and its colleagues in the IRS have increased their efforts in this area, and are holding delinquent employers accountable.Fairness in the employment tax arena is an important part of the nations tax system, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. The IRS is committed to working with the Justice Department to protect this important area, and theres a long list of efforts weve taken in both civil and criminal investigation areas when employers try to evade their legal responsibilities and, in the process, gain an advantage over their competitors who are honoring their legal responsibilities. In addition, the IRS is taking new steps to identify and contact employers falling behind on their payments before they file their tax returns, offering to assist them earlier in the process to head off steeper interest and penalty charges. This effort not only provides an important service, it could help prevent the need for future enforcement activity.Willful Failure to Comply with Federal Employment Tax Laws is a CrimeAn individuals failure to comply with employment-tax obligations is not simply a civil matter. Employers who view amounts withheld from employee wages as a personal slush fund, treat withheld employment taxes as a loan from the government that can be repaid if and when they see fit, or whose business model is based on a continued failure to pay employment tax, are engaging in criminal conduct and face prosecution, imprisonment, monetary fines and restitution. According to statistics provided by IRS Criminal Investigation, in the 2015 fiscal year, individuals convicted of employment tax crimes were sentenced to an average of 24 months in prison. Recent prosecutions include:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneDelinquent Employers also face Civil Litigation and InjunctionsEmployers that ignore their employment tax obligations will face civil enforcement efforts, including federal lawsuits to enjoin noncompliance, ensure future compliance, and collect amounts due.NoneWhen individuals and entities subject to these injunctions knowingly violate the terms of the injunction, the Tax Division stands ready to seek orders of civil or criminal contempt, including incarceration, to bring the defendants into compliance.Liability Extends to Responsible IndividualsAny individual who is responsible for ensuring that employment taxes are collected, accounted for, and paid over to the IRS, and willfully fails to do so may be subject to a civil penalty equal to the amount of the unpaid withholdings. This civil penalty, referred to as the trust fund recovery penalty, may be imposed even if the individual uses the employment tax to pay other creditors or keep the business afloat. Individuals subject to these penalties include, but are not limited to, bookkeepers, managers, treasurers, and corporate officers. The Department assists the IRS to defend challenges to trust fund recovery penalty assessments, and to ensure that such assessments are collected.In August 2015, a federal court in Michigan heldthat Eric Kus and Roger Byrne, the chairman and the president of an automobile interior trim manufacturer, were liable for unpaid employment taxes even though they did not know that the taxes were unpaid. The court found that they recklessly disregarded known risks that the employment taxes would not be paid because they relied on the companys controller, who they knew had previously failed to pay employment taxes when they were due.NoneThe American taxpayer should not be forced to subsidize businesses that refuse to comply with the tax laws, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo. The Justice Department and the IRS will continue to identify, investigate, and hold accountable those individuals and businesses that willfully evade their employment tax obligations.None
