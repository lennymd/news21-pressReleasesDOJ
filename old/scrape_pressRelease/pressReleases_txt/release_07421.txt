The Justice Department has reached an agreement with the city of Memphis, Tenn., under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to improve physical accessibility for people with disabilities at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, home of the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, Memphis Tigers and Southern Heritage Classic football games. Todays agreement marks a new chapter for historic Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, which will permit all spectators, with and without disabilities, to attend college football games  both regular season and bowl games -- at the stadium, said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Under the settlement agreement, Memphis will install a total of 282 wheelchair spaces and an equal number of companion seats around the stadium at Row 25, and in the upper concourses on the home and away sides of the Liberty Bowl. The agreement requires installation of additional wheelchair spaces in seating areas renovated in the future, such as the suites and press boxes. The 282 wheelchair spaces will be dispersed vertically and horizontally throughout the Liberty Bowl, and will provide people in wheelchairs with lines of sight over standing spectators that are comparable to those offered to individuals without disabilities. In addition, Memphis will ensure ADA compliance for concession stands, gates, elevators, suites and press boxes, ramps, and restrooms throughout the Liberty Bowl. Memphis will retain an architect to certify that the city has corrected each ADA violation. Memphis must report its progress to the United States. Todays agreement was reached under Title II of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by state and local governments. The Department will actively monitor the citys compliance with the agreement, which will remain in effect for three years. NoneLiberty Bowl Settlement Agreement
