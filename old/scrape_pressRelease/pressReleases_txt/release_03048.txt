Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch released the following statement on the departure of Kelly T. Currie of the Eastern District of New York:Kelly Currie is a consummate public servant: dedicated, selfless, and fair. As a senior advisor to former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, Kelly played a crucial role in achieving the Good Friday Agreement, which brought lasting peace to the people of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. During two stints as an attorney in the Eastern District of New York  including his tenure as my Chief Assistant during my time there as U.S. Attorney  he was instrumental to the offices prosecution of cases involving corruption, securities fraud and terrorism. And when I became Attorney General last April, Kelly graciously served as Acting U.S. Attorney  a role he filled with characteristic skill, energy and integrity. Through these and many other contributions, Kelly has helped to make our country  and our world  safer and more just. I want to thank him for his outstanding work, and I wish him the best as he begins a new chapter in his career.
