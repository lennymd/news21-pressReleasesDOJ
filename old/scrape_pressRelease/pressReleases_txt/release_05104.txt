The following statement is attributable to Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon:The Attorney General participated in a conference call this afternoon with federal, state and local elected officials from Missouri. The Attorney General thanked the elected officials for their work in planning the local response to the ongoing demonstrations in and around Ferguson. He said he was encouraged by reports he has received about progress being made in those planning efforts, including dialogue with coalition leaders about constructive engagement in the weeks ahead. The Attorney General stressed that going forward, it will be more important than ever that the law enforcement response to the demonstrations always seek to deescalate tensions and respect the rights of protestors. At the same time, the Attorney General said, it must be clearly communicated that any acts of violence by the demonstrators, or other attempts to provoke law enforcement, are unacceptable.With respect to the Departments ongoing investigations into both the shooting of Michael Brown and the Ferguson police department generally, the Attorney General said he could not provide a specific timeline for concluding those inquiries. He did stress, however, that he had devoted significant resources to these investigations in order to ensure they are conducted in as thorough and expeditious a manner as possible.The Attorney General concluded by offering the Departments continued assistance, and by urging continued and direct communication between elected officials, law enforcement, and community leaders in the days ahead to help deescalate tensions and assist with planning.
