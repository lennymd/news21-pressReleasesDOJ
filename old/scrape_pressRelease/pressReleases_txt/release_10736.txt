None NoneNone None       As a part of the bid-rigging conspiracy, kickbacks in the form of inflated or unearned fees were paid by Campbells employer to CDR in exchange for assistance in controlling the bidding process and ensuring that certain co-conspirator providers won the bids they were allocated.None       The court documents also charge that Campbell and co-conspirators misrepresented to municipal issuers or their bond counsel that the bidding process was in compliance with U.S. Treasury regulations.  This caused the municipal issuers to award investment agreements and other municipal finance contracts to providers that otherwise would not have been awarded the contracts if the issuers had true and accurate information regarding the bidding process.  Such conduct caused municipal issuers to file inaccurate reports with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and thus placed the tax-exempt status of the underlying bonds in jeopardy.       The bid-rigging conspiracy for which Campbell is charged carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.  The fraud conspiracy for which Campbell is charged carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The maximum fines for each of these offenses may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.        This is the seventh guilty plea to arise from an ongoing investigation into the municipal bonds industry, which is being conducted by the Antitrust Divisions New York Field Office, the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation.  The department is coordinating its investigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.       Three former employees of CDR have pleaded guilty to bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies in relation to the ongoing investigation.  Three other individuals have pleaded guilty to charges related to the ongoing investigation.  In addition, three former financial services executives were indicted on July 27, 2010, for participating in fraud schemes and conspiracies related to the bidding for investment agreements.  In October 2009, CDR, two of its employees and one former employee were charged for participating in bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies and related crimes.  The CDR trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 12, 2011.   None None
