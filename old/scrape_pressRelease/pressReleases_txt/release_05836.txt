Garrett from preparing tax returns for others or working for any business that prepares tax returns for others, the Justice Department announced today. The courts injunction, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, also requires Garrett to contact and provide a copy of the injunction order to every customer for whom she prepared a tax return since 2011. Garrett agreed to the permanent injunction, which was entered against her by the court on April 30, 2014.The complaint alleged that Garrett, while working at multiple Chicago-area tax preparation businesses, including Instant Tax Service, Preferred Financial and Income Tax Solutions, claimed fraudulent deductions and credits on her customers federal tax returns. Examples cited in the complaint include returns prepared by Garrett for customers that falsely claimed thousands of dollars in bogus deductions from entirely fake businesses.NoneRelated Materials:None
