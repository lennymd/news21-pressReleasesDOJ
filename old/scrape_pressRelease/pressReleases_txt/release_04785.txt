Today, the U.S. Department of Justices Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Diagnostic Center and the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) released the final assessment and implementation plans to support the MPDs accountability procedures. The Diagnostic Analysis will allow MPD to implement changes that will improve police and community trust in the Minneapolis community. The assessment focused on goals set by MPD including improving police accountability and preventing officer misconduct.NoneStrengthening relationships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve is one of the defining public safety challenges of our time, said Assistant Attorney General Karol V. Mason for the Office of Justice Programs. I commend Chief [Jane] Harteau for calling on the resources of the OJP Diagnostic Center and for her commitment to building trust with the citizens of Minneapolis.In 2014, the Diagnostic Center conducted an independent assessment including community stakeholder interviews and data analysis to identify promising practices for police accountability related to managing oversight and preventing misconduct. In October 2014, the Diagnostic Center presented its assessment findings to the MPD and broader Minneapolis community. Since the presentation of the Diagnostic Centers Analysis, the MPD has moved forward with creating five committees comprising representatives from MPD, the Office of Police Conduct Review, city leadership and the community to address recommendations on police conduct, early interventions systems, community outreach, and coaching and strategic communications.The work that the Minneapolis Police Department and the Diagnostic Center have embarked on fits squarely into the goals of community safety, officer safety and criminal justice reform that the Justice Department has made a top priority, said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mark Kappelhoff for the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. I applaud Chief Harteau, the Minneapolis Police Department and the community on their leadership and commitment to implementing sustainable solutions that will lead to increased public trust and safety for everyone.NoneNone
