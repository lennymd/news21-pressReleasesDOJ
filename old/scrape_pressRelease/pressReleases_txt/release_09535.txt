Balyasny and Shrayber, both of Brooklyn, are licensed pharmacists in New York State who co-owned and operated Monicas Pharmacy and L & A Pharmacy.      According to court documents, from January 2007 through December 2009, Balyasny and Shrayber allegedly defrauded the Medicare Part D program by systematically submitting false claims through their pharmacies for certain prescription medications that were not purchased by their businesses and were never dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries.
