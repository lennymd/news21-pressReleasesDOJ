None  Attorney General Eric Holder today welcomed the confirmation of Christopher H. Schroeder as the new Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Departments Office of Legal Policy (OLP). Schroeder was confirmed today by the U.S. Senate.  "I am pleased to welcome Chris back to the Department of Justice," said Attorney General Holder. "The Office of Legal Policy serves a crucial role at the department in coordinating some of our most important projects and initiatives. Chris is an experienced and talented attorney, and I look forward to working with him on behalf of the American people."  OLP is responsible for developing policy initiatives of high priority to the Department and the Administration. Assistant Attorney General Schroeder will serve as the primary policy advisor to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. As the Departments think tank, OLP provides a space distinct from the Departments day-to-day work for long-term planning that anticipates and helps to shape the terms of national debate on a wide range of forthcoming legal policy.  Most recently, Schroeder was the Charles S. Murphy Professor of Law and Professor of Public Policy Studies, and director of the Program in Public Law at Duke University Law School. Previously, he served as Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, where he was responsible for legal advice to the attorney general, the executive office of the president and other executive branch agencies on a broad range of issues, including separation of powers, other constitutional issues, and matters of statutory interpretation and administrative law. He has also served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Schroeder received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1968, a M.Div. from Yale University in 1971, and his J.D. degree from University of California, Berkeley in 1974.
