The Justice Department today announced an extensive effort to disrupt and dismantle the Kelihos botnet  a global network of tens of thousands of infected computers under the control of a cybercriminal that was used to facilitate malicious activities including harvesting login credentials, distributing hundreds of millions of spam e-mails, and installing ransomware and other malicious software.Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder for the District of Alaska, Assistant Director Scott Smith for the FBIs Cyber Division and FBI Special Agent in Charge Marlin Ritzman of the AnchorageDivision made the announcement.The operation announced today targeted an ongoing international scheme that was distributing hundreds of millions of fraudulent e-mails per year, intercepting the credentials to online and financial accounts belonging to thousands of Americans, and spreading ransomware throughout our networks. The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerousand deepthreat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday lives,said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco.Our success in disrupting the Kelihos botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics.The Department of Justiceiscommitted to combatting cybercrime, no matter the size or sophistication of the scheme, and to punish those who are engaged in such crimes.Cybercrime is a worldwide problem, but one that infects its victims directly through the computers and personal electronic devices that we use every day, said Acting U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder for the District of Alaska.Protecting the American people from such a worldwide threat requires a broad-reaching response, and the dismantling of the Kelihos botnet was such an operation.We are lucky that we have talented FBI agents and federal prosecutors with the skillsets to help protect Americans from this pervasive cybercrime.On April 8, 2017, we started the extraordinary task of blocking malicious domains associated with the Khelios botnet to prohibit further infections, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Ritzman.
