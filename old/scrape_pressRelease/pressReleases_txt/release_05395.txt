    Child Cyber Safety Night at the Ballpark is the latest effort by the Justice Department and its law enforcement and community partners to encourage parents to speak with their children about online and cell phone safety and provide prevention materials. As part of the event, the department will receive the Washington Nationals Spirit Award. Deputy Attorney General James Cole will be recognized in an on-field ceremony at Nationals Park along with Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Administrator Robert L. Listenbee, and Special Agent in Charge Tim Gallagher of the FBI Washington Field Office.      The Spirit Award will be announced during the pre-game show scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 6, 2014, before the 4:05 p.m. Major League Baseball game between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies.     In a public service announcement to be shown at the game, Attorney General Eric Holder will emphasize the importance of creating an ongoing dialogue with children about safe use of technology.     As a parent, I understand the opportunities  and the challenges  that new technologies present for Americas young people, Attorney General Holder will say in the announcement. Its up to each of us to start a dialogue with our kids about safe Internet and cell phone practices. Together, we can ensure that our kids are safe and protected  both online and off.     Child Cyber Safety Night at the Ballpark is a large-scale awareness event being led by INOBTR (I Know Better), a non-profit organization and OJJDP grantee focused on promoting youth safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program (ICAC) will join INOBTR in sharing resources for parents and children via the Community Clubhouse at the Center Field Plaza. Materials will be available when the gates open Saturday at 1:30 p.m. through the third inning of the game.  None None
