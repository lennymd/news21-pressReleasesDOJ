A former Lorain County, Ohio corrections officer pleaded guilty today to one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, announced Jocelyn Samuels, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, Steven M. Dettelbach, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio and Stephen D. Anthony, Special Agent in Charge of the FBIs Cleveland Office.According to court documents, Marlon Tayor, 47, of Vermilion, Ohio, assaulted an inmate by striking him repeatedly while working as a corrections officer in the Lorain County Jail.These actions caused bodily injury to the inmate and deprived the inmate of the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, according to court documents.We in the Civil Rights Division are committed to working with our partners in the U.S. Attorneys Office and the FBI to identify, and where appropriate, prosecute instances of law enforcement abuse, said Acting Assitant Attorney General Samuels.The vast majority of law enforcement officials do a great job, said U.S. Attorney Dettelbach said. When someone abuses the power and privileges of their office, however, they can and will be held accountable.The acknowledgment of excessive force exhibited by a fellow officer in law enforcement is disconcerting, said Special Agent in Charge Anthony. The public should be reminded that the vast majority of those serving within the criminal justice system do so with honor and integrity. Any allegation of abuse or excessive force involving law enforcement officers takes on a particular sense of urgency and will continue to be a priority for the FBI.Taylor is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 19, 2013.This investigation was conducted by the FBIs Cleveland Office. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antoinette T. Bacon and Lauren Bell and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl.
