Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodrguez-Vlez.   The defendants were sentenced in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by U.S. District Court Judge Paul J. Barbadoro, sitting by designation from the District of New Hampshire.      Former Puerto Rico Governor Anbal Acevedo Vil , 47, and Luisa Incln Bird, 49, a legal advisor for the San Juan resident commissioner office when Acevedo Vil served as resident commissioner, were acquitted on March 20, 2009, of all criminal charges related to the scheme.        The five defendants sentenced were:        According to plea documents, Velasco Mella, Velasco Escardille and Col  n Rodriguez admitted to participating in a scheme to defraud the United States and violate various FECA provisions by having Puerto Rico and Philadelphia-area businessmen make illegal and unreported contributions to pay off large and unreported debts stemming from the former governors campaign in 2000 for resident commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.   The defendants admitted that the scheme involved soliciting, accepting, and then reimbursing illegal conduit contributions from the candidates family members and staff.   Conduit contributions are illegal campaign contributions made by one person in the name of another person.   According to plea documents, payments were made principally to the campaigns public relations firm, Lopito, Ileana and Howie.   Also, the illegal actions continued into 2003, due to the significant debt accumulated by the campaign, some of which was also concealed from the FEC and the public.      According to court documents, the scheme continued through unreported fundraising and the making of unrecorded vendor payments for the former governors 2004 gubernatorial campaign in order to raise and spend far more than the limited amount that Puerto Rican law permitted.   According to court documents and the statements of the defendants who pleaded guilty, Puerto Rico businessmen, described in court documents as collaborators, used large amounts of money from their personal or corporate funds to pay for large and unreported debts to the campaigns public relations firm.   Large sums of cash were also used to keep contributions and vendor payments concealed from the Puerto Rico Treasury Department and the public.   According to court documents, for many of the collaborator payments, the public relations company created fake invoices to make the payments appear to be legitimate business expenses of the collaborators companies.   As Finance Director for the 2004 gubernatorial campaign, Nazario Franco became aware of this illegal activity and pleaded guilty for failing to report it.   Gonz  lez Freyre pleaded guilty to making a false statement during the federal investigation into his illegal $50,000 contribution to the 2004 gubernatorial campaign.
