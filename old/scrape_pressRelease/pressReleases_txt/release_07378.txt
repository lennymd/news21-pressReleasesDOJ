NoneAccording to the indictment, the defendants companies had childrens toys seized by CBP from shipping containers entering the United States from China on 33 separate occasions. Seventeen of the 33 seizures were of violative toys  toys prohibited from import into and distribution in the United States, under laws and regulations enforced by the CPSC, because of excessive lead content, excessive phthalate levels, small parts that presented choking, aspiration or ingestion hazards, and easily accessible battery compartments. Sixteen of the 33 seizures were of toys bearing copyright-infringing images and counterfeit trademarks, including knockoff versions of toys featuring a wide variety of popular childrens characters, such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Betty Boop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spiderman, Tweety, Mickey Mouse, Pokmon, as well as those from movies, such as the Cars, Toy Story and High School Musical.The indictment charges that following each of the 33 seizures, the violator toy company was served written notice by CBP detailing the reason for the seizure, and a representative of the company signed a release form acknowledging the seizure and abandoning the seized goods. Additionally, the violator company and its principal were served written notice by CPSC of the specific safety violations of the toys, and each time a representative of the company signed a release form acknowledging the seizure and abandoning the seized goods.Due to the number and volume of the seizures, the individual defendants allegedly shifted their use of the companies and alternated formal roles, in order to continue importing and distributing violative and infringing toys. Each time the number of seizures accumulated for one company, the individual defendants allegedly formed a new toy company to continue importing the violative and infringing toys.The people and companies involved in this illegal trade not only allegedly infringed on intellectual property rights, they placed the lives of innocent children in danger, said HSI Special Agent in Charge Hayes. They allegedly sold toys with high lead content and cheap knock offs with substandard parts that break easily and pose a choking hazard. HSI is firm on using its unique customs expertise and law enforcement partnerships to put an end to the importation and sale of dangerous goods.Customs and Border Protection is on the forefront of intercepting unsafe, counterfeit products, said CBP New York Field Operations Director Perez. We are proud to have done our part preventing these dangerous toys from getting in the hands of our children.Todays action highlights the unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination among federal regulatory and law enforcement partners to keep U.S. consumers safe, said CPSC Chairman Tenenbaum. The United States has some of the strongest toy standards and lowest lead limits in the world, and CPSC is committed to enforcing these child safety requirements at the ports and in the marketplace.When it comes to trademark infringement, dont mess with Mickey or other American icons, said NYPD Commissioner Kelly.In the indictment, the government is seeking forfeiture of the seized vehicles and bank accounts and the restrained properties, in addition to a money judgment to be determined at trial.The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Evan Williams of the Criminal Divisions Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claire Kedeshian and William Campos of the Eastern District of New York.
