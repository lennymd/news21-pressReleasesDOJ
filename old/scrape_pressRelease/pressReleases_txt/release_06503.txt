None   Separate felony charges were filed on Sept. 25, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta, against Penguin Properties LLC and its owner, Seth D. Lynn.None   Charges were also brought against Penguin Properties and Lynn for their involvement in similar conspiracies in DeKalb County, Ga., from at least as early as July 6, 2004 until at least Jan. 3, 2012.   Todays charges are the first to be filed in the state of Georgia in the Antitrust Divisions ongoing investigation into anticompetitive conduct in real estate foreclosure auctions, said Bill Baer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justices Antitrust Division. The divisions investigation has already resulted in dozens of guilty pleas in other states, and the division remains committed to eliminating anticompetitive practices at foreclosure auctions.   The department said that the primary purpose of the conspiracies was to suppress and restrain competition and to conceal payoffs in order to obtain selected real estate offered at Fulton and DeKalb County public foreclosure auctions at non-competitive prices. When real estate properties are sold at these auctions, the proceeds are used to pay off the mortgage and other debt attached to the property, with remaining proceeds, if any, paid to the homeowner. According to court documents, these conspirators paid and received money that otherwise would have gone to pay off the mortgage and other holders of debt secured by the properties, and, in some cases, the defaulting homeowner.
