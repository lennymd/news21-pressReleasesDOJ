The defendant allegedly aided, advised and prepared false individual income tax returns for the tax years 2005 through 2008 for at least seven taxpayers.

If convicted, the defendant faces a potential maximum sentence of three years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 on each count.      This case was investigated by the IRS-Criminal Investigation and is being prosecuted by Tax Division Trial Attorneys Jessica Moran and Erin Pulice.
