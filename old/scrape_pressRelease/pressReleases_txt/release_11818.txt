None  On September 14, 2009, the Department of Justice marked the fifteenth anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the creation of its Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). The department has kicked-off a year-long effort to raise public awareness, build stronger coalitions among federal, state, local and tribal communities, and redouble efforts to end domestic and dating violence, sexual assault and stalking for men, women and children across the country.  "We knowdomestic violence is an epidemic thataffects communitiesacross this country regardless of age, race or socio-economic background," said Attorney General Eric Holder. "We will continue to provide the resources necessary tohelp our law enforcement partners protect our neighborhoods against violence, andwe stand ready to work with victim service providers who do so much to assist the survivors, families and children affected by this tragic crime."  "Domestic Violence Awareness Month is an important moment to recognize that we can all be agents of social change and end violence against women," said OVW Acting Director Catherine Pierce. "In the fifteen years since the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law, countless lives have been saved, the voices of survivors have been heard and families have been protected. We are proud of how far we have come but keenly aware that there is much to do. The Office on Violence Against Women is proud to join our partners and grantees throughout the country to observe October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month."  OVW, a component of the Department of Justice, provides leadership in developing the nations capacity to reduce violence against women through the implementation of VAWA and subsequent legislation. Created in 1995, OVW administers financial and technical assistance to communities across the country that are developing programs, policies and practices aimed at ending domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.None
