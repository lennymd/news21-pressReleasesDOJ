The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $16.7 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $11.9 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.           The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Ohio; the Justice Departments Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.None
