      Saint Joseph Health System Inc. has agreed to pay $16.5 million to resolve allegations that Saint Joseph Hospital violated the False Claims Act by submitting false claims to the Medicare and Kentucky Medicaid programs for a variety of medically unnecessary cardiac procedures, the Justice Department announced today. Saint Joseph Health System operates numerous hospitals statewide, including Saint Joseph Hospital, which is based in London, Ky.  None       The government alleged that doctors working at Saint Joseph Hospital performed numerous invasive cardiac procedures, including coronary stents, pacemakers, coronary artery bypass graft surgeries and diagnostic catheterizations, on Medicare and Medicaid patients who did not need them, and that the hospital was aware of these unnecessary procedures. These doctors were affiliated with Cumberland Clinic which is a physician group that entered an exclusive arrangement with Saint Joseph Hospital in 2008 to provide cardiology services to the hospitals patients. Cumberland Clinic is owned by two London-based cardiologists, Satyabrata Chatterjee and Ashwini Anand.        The settlement also resolves allegations that Saint Joseph Hospital violated the federal Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute by entering into sham management agreements that financially benefitted Chatterjee and Anand as an inducement for Chatterjee and Anand to direct more Cumberland Clinic patients to the hospital.        Dr. Sandesh Patil, one of the Cumberland Clinic cardiologists working at the hospital, performed many of the medically unnecessary coronary stents. Patil has since pleaded guilty to a federal health care fraud offense and has been sentenced to serve 30 months in prison.       We all rely on health care providers to make treatment decisions based on clinical, not financial, considerations, said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky Kerry Harvey. The conduct alleged in this case violates that fundamental trust and squanders scarce public resources set aside for legitimate health care needs. We will use every available tool to protect our federal health care programs and the patients who they serve.        In connection with this settlement, Saint Joseph Hospital has agreed to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), which obligates the hospital to undertake substantial internal compliance reforms and to commit to a third-party review of its claims to federal health care programs for the next five years.       "Cases such as this threaten both the health of patients and the financial integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs," said Special Agent in Charge at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General in Atlanta Derrick L. Jackson. "This settlement is another example of the OIGs commitment to protecting our beneficiaries and to recovering any money that has been improperly paid as a result of medically unnecessary procedures."       In addition to the settlement with Saint Joseph Health System, the government announced its intervention in a lawsuit alleging False Claims Act violations by Chatterjee and Anand, who referred patients for and performed the unnecessary procedures and tests, and their practice group, Cumberland Clinic, as well the practice groups each of them owned before forming Cumberland Clinic.  None       This settlement illustrates the governments emphasis on combating health care fraud and marks another achievement for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced in May 2009 by Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered a total of more than $17.1 billion through False Claims Act cases, with more than $12.2 billion of that amount recovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.
