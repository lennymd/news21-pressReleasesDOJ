Fana admitted that the conspirators then trafficked in the cellphone customers telecommunication identifying information, using that data as well as other software and hardware to reprogram cellphones that they controlled to transmit thousands of international calls to Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and other countries with high calling rates. The calls were billed to the victims compromised accounts, he admitted.Fanas role in the scheme included operating a call site in his residence in Miami Gardens, according to the plea agreement.

According to the plea agreement, Fanas co-conspirators would then transmit international calls over the internet to Fanas residence, where he would route them through the re-programmed cellphones. In October 2012, the FBI executed a search warrant on Fanas residence and discovered approximately 88 cellphones connected to networking equipment and actively routing calls.Fana admitted that law enforcement seized nearly 11,000 telecommunications identifying numbers from him and that the scheme caused at least $1 million in losses.The FBI investigated the case, dubbed Operation Toll Free, which is part of the bureaus ongoing effort to combat large-scale telecommunications fraud.
