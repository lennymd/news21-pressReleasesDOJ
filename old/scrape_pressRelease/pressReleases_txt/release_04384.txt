Acting U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rose released the following statement on the sentencing of David Petraeus:Good afternoon. David Petraeus appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Keesler of the Western District of North Carolina today and admitted to the unauthorized removal and retention of classified information and lying to the FBI and CIA about his possession and handling of classified information. Petraeus was sentenced to a two-year probationary term and was ordered to pay $100,000 fine. I want to thank my colleagues at DOJ National Security Division, the Charlotte FBI office for leading the investigation, as well as all our investigative partners for their work on the case.
