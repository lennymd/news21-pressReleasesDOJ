      Attorney General Eric Holder issued the following statement today:None        I welcome the Supreme Courts decision to strike down major provisions of Arizonas S.B. 1070on federal preemption grounds. Todays ruling appropriately bars the State of Arizonafrom effectively criminalizing unlawful status in the state and confirms the federal governments exclusive authority to regulate in the area of immigration.     While I am pleased the Court confirmed the serious constitutional questions the government raised regarding Section 2, I remain concerned about the impact of Section 2, which requires law enforcement officials to verify the immigration status of any person lawfully stopped or detained when they have reason to suspect that the person is here unlawfully. As the Court itself recognized, Section 2 is not a license to engage in racial profiling and I want to assure communities around this country that the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously enforce federal prohibitions against racial and ethnic discrimination.We will closely monitor the impact of S.B. 1070 to ensure compliance with federal immigration law and with applicable civil rights laws, including ensuring that law enforcement agencies and others do not implement the law in a manner that has the purpose or effect of discriminating against the Latino or any other community.     We will also work to ensure that the verification provision does notdivertpolice officers away from traditional law enforcement efforts in order to enforce federal immigration law,potentiallyimpairing local policing efforts and discouraging crime victims, including children of non-citizens, victims of domestic violence, and asylum seekers, from reporting abuses and crimes out of fear of detention or deportation. We will continue touseevery federal resource to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans.
