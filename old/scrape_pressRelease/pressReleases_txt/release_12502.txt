  WASHINGTON  The United States has intervened in a whistleblower suit filed in the District of New Mexicoagainst Community Health Systems Inc. (CHS) and three of its hospitals in New Mexico: Eastern New Mexico Medical Center in Roswell, Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, and Alta Vista Regional Hospital in Las Vegas. The suit alleges that CHS and its three hospitals violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by knowingly causing to be presented to the United States false claims for federal matching Medicaid funds, the Justice Department announced today.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act) authorizes federal matching funds to the states for Medicaid programs to provide medical assistance to persons with limited income and resources. In order to ensure that state or local funds are the basis for the federal matching money, the Medicaid Act prohibits federal funding in instances where the state or county has received donations from health care providers that are related to the amount of Medicaid reimbursement paid to the provider.None  The relators complaint alleges that beginning in the summer of 2000, CHS and its three New Mexico hospitals improperly obtained federal funds through the New Mexico Sole Community Provider Fund (SCPF) and Sole Community Hospital Supplemental Payments (SCHSP) Medicaid programs. In particular, the relator alleges that CHS and its hospitals made donations to New Mexico counties which they knew would be used by the counties and the state to claim and obtain triple that amount in federal funding that was then paid to the hospitals under the SCPF and SCHSP programs. The relator alleges that CHS donation arrangement violated the Medicaid Acts prohibition of provider donations that are related to the amount of Medicaid reimbursement paid to the provider.None  The investigation was conducted by the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.
