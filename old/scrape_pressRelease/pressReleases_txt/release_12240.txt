  The Department has filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Arkansas against the City of Marion alleging it subjected Stacy D. Allen, an African-American and a former City part-time patrol officer, to discrimination on the basis of his race when he was not selected for either of two full-time patrol officer positions in the Marion Police Department.  The complaint alleges that Marion had a history of placing the most senior part-time patrol officer in a full-time officer position when it became available, except when Allen should have been selected based on seniority. The complaint seeks remedial relief for Allen, including back pay with interest, and compensatory damages. Allen is currently employed as a full-time police officer with the West Memphis, Ark., Police Department.  "The Justice Department is committed to the vigorous enforcement of all federal civil rights laws under its jurisdiction, including Title VIIs prohibition of discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin and religion," said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division.None
