Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli announced today that the Justice Departments grant-making components have created a streamlined approach for American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities to apply for Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 funding opportunities. The Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS) will serve as a single solicitation for existing tribal government-specific grant programs administered by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). This move comes after consultation with tribal leaders, including sessions at the departments Tribal Nations Listening Session last year."This is a direct result of what we heard from tribal leaders at the department's listening session. Tribal leaders have made it clear that a single application would significantly improve their ability to apply and receive critical federal funding, which so many of their communities depend on," said Associate Attorney General Perrelli. "This comprehensive approach is another step in our efforts to work more effectively with tribal communities to improve public safety in those communities."The Justice Department solicited input from tribal leaders on how to make a change to a single application process that would work most effectively for tribal grant applicants. For the FY2010 grant process, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities will submit a single application for all available tribal government-specific grant programs. This coordinated approach will allow the departments grant-making components to consider the totality of a tribal communitys overall public safety needs. OJP, COPS and OVW will then coordinate in making award decisions to address these needs on a more comprehensive basis. The Department of Justice has begun providing information about the new process to tribal communities this week, with an expected solicitation process launch in mid-March.Native communities and tribal consortiums may be eligible for other non-tribal government-specific grant-funding opportunities and are encouraged to submit a separate application to any grant programs for which they may be eligible. OVWs "Grants to Tribal Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Coalitions" will not be included in the single solicitation and application; OVW will release a separate solicitation and application and eligible applicants must apply separately for this grant program.Todays announcement is part of the Justice Departments ongoing initiative to increase engagement, coordination and action on public safety in tribal communities.Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation Fact Sheet
