Diego Martinez, 28, pleaded guilty yesterday to making false statements to the FBI during a federal hate crime investigation arising from a June 19, 2015, bias-motivated assault of three black Somali men in Dodge City, Kansas. Martinez pleaded guilty in the District of Kansas to one count of making materially false statements to the FBI during an October 2015 voluntary interview.  None Hate violence not only harms individuals but also threatens the diversity of our society and the well-being of our communities, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler for the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute hate crimes, and to pursue defendants who, like Mr. Martinez, obstruct the investigations into those crimes. Martinez will be sentenced on June 1, 2017, and faces a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison.  This case was investigated by the FBIs Garden City Resident Agency with assistance from the Dodge City Police and the Ford County, Kansas, Sheriffs Departments. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Risa Berkower and Special Litigation Counsel Jared Fishman of the Civil Rights Divisions Criminal Section, with assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst of the District of Kansas.
